## Research Notes

So, I was going through some ACME Evil Corp files, right? And there it was, this seemingly ordinary memo. But something felt off. I took a closer look and found some sketchy stuff in there, like secret codes or something. Man, I'm pretty sure I found evidence of some real bad crimes. But, you know, I didn't want to blab about it and get into trouble. So, I just sent the key info to a buddy of mine who's into this investigative stuff too, just in case anything happens to me. Honestly, it feels like I'm about to blow the lid off some major shady business that ACME Evil Corp's been hiding.

## Next Steps

If you're reading this and looking for me - I'm OK.

Here's what you need to do know to get the info from my buddy...

Go up to whoever is running the class and ask them *"Do you know where Sarah keeps her recipe books?"*

If they ask how you know Sarah, say *"we met at Polyfest"*...

If they believe you they will give you the folder name... go find this folder name in the link I emailed you earlier.

Good luck!!
