I am running this from my local machine, with AWS creds and config setup with keys.

## Tools Install

All good, nothing new.

## Environment Setup

Following [this](https://ecsworkshop.com/monitoring/container_insights/build_environment/).

From the same setup as [Microservices](/website/docs/engineer/AWS/AWS-ECS-1Microservices.md), you now setup the the app via CDK scripts instead.
