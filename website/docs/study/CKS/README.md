## Courses

My main study material was [Kubernetes CKS 2021 Complete Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103O5A3@tvmhKg4QOGimr2W3jgLP2nxMOL5LC86ZUnUdOdW74r7CnMjwY6XTOY7owUd6z63ALQ==/) by Kim WÃ¼stkamp. Very good course and I would recommend it to get a good grasp of the topics for examination.

At the end of the course I signed up for my CKS exam where you get 2 x [killer.sh](https://killer.sh) simulators included in the CKS exam purchase. I completed both of these.

Unfortunately, the simulators weren't enough preparation for my first take of the exam and I failed with a 60, where a 67 was required to pass. The exam is 2 hours for 16 questions and I took too long trying to decipher the questions and then fumbling the commands.

For my retake I was determined to drill more exam scenrios so I purchased a subscription to [kodekloud](https://kodekloud.com/) and drilled their 3 x available CKS mock exams, which helped familiarize myself with exam scenario questions, the terminal setup and speed and accuracy of my CLI commands.

### Notes

My notes from Kim's course are oraganised below in their respective sections according the the CKS curriculum table.
