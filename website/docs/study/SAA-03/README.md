## Overview

A demonstrated ability to build secure and robust solutions using architectural design principles based on customer requirements. You are able to strategically design well-architected distributed systems that are scalable, resilient, efficient, and fault-tolerant.

## Resources

### Udemy Course

I used the [Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C03](https://www.udemy.com/share/106WtA3@2SAIMamyPyAN4rIsHXAJAuv7r-NLwBl4MPsLLQlCF3vT0ulR9wNE0xfNByjT9UqnmA==/) by Stephane Maarek. It was OK. I don't think I would use his material again in future, it may good for cramming for the exam, but I don't really feel like I know the material after doing his course.

### Flashcards

I used Remnote again to create a bunch of flashcards to help the rote memorization of detail-specific things.
