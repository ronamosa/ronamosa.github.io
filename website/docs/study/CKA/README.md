## Courses

My main study material was the ["Kubernetes Fundamentals (LFS258)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-fundamentals/) which I do _**not**_ recommend. It had a lot of misaligned information due to bits and pieces of the course material being updated, so the examples and some content didn't line up correctly or make sense.
