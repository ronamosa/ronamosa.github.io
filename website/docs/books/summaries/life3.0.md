My notes and thoughts on "Life 3.0" by Max Tegmark.

One argument of this book is that the AI conversation is _"the most important conversation of our time"_ because of the immense power that AI can and will potentially have.

So we **must** have this conversation and figure it out before Artificial General Intelligence (AGI i.e. the "real" AI) arrives, because by that time it will be too late.

## The Omega Team (prelude)

This, imo, was a good framing of the "AI and it's possibilities" space, the story of the Omega Team and the Prometheus AI it develops that eventually takes over the world- secretly- but in a benevolent and "for the best outcome for humanity" way.

A few key ideas around, how the AI is developed, who's developing it and what their biases and objectives are- which is all very generic and would probably fall apart on closer inspection- but what was interesting was charting the path from unleashing it on a money-earning programme in order to become self-funding, but always careful to not "do too much" in case it reveal itself to the world.

Prometheus is the AI that improves itself- i.e. the idea around an AI that can learn and improve itself exponetially beyond what humans can do, and it's off to the races with learning and growing in power. At which point the humans need to bake in controls for it not getting out into the world and pursuing it's own objectives independant of humankind.

The book goes on to explore each aspect of this fictional story.

### Technologies + Tools

The story goes on to detail how the AI first uses the technologies and tools that already exist i.e. firstly money, and then with enough money it would create companies and business plans on how to expand. These plans included using more recent technologies like AI-generated movies written by the AI pushing the narratives it needed to influence public perspectives. It also included playing the stock market, putting human-and-their-evil-ways businesses out of commission and creating economies, jobs and businesses that were better for "the greater good" of humanity and not the billionaire or political class that currently hoard all of humanities resources.

It's interesting those platforms like the stock market, TV, Facebook, Netflix, corporations, making movies, writing songs- can all be reduced to components of influence (co-ersion? manipulation?) towards an ideal, or set of ideals. And the same medium of information gathering and disclosure i.e. the internet, feeds massive amounts of data to an AI in order to learn well enough about humanity and what makes us tick to craft the right products and services to move us towards the goals.

Even Prometheus' way of gaining political influence no matter the level of a countries censorship by the use of TV and controlling the content (increase good info, descrease ads and misinfo) going on to become the most trusted source of news, thereby controlling the countries intake of information.

### New Technologies

Sure, the AI is smart enough (in the story) to invent new technologies way beyond human imagination, things we've never considered or could see with our limited intelligence, which I guess is part of the point of this book- even if some of these ideas are outlandish or pretty far out, we _have to_ consider them as some of the things that exist today (mobile phones, the internet, reality TV) were once also pretty "far out" ideas.

## Chapter 1: The Most Important Conversation of our Time.

### The 3 stages of life

|version|stage|self-replicate|design own software (knowledge)|design own hardware (physical)|
|:----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
|1.0 | simple biology | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
|2.0 | cultural | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
|3.0 | technological | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

The idea here is that `1.0` biology (hardware) takes time to evolve, but once we got the software, `2.0` going i.e. our knowledge system, how we learn and adapt and improve, that progressed way beyond what our biology was doing.

`3.0` is where we start thinking about Cyborgs, "uploads" (where we upload our consciousness to a machine and free it from the `1.0` hardware life), other things independant of what we've been currently using and experiencing so far i.e. the biological form.

### Future of Life Institute (FLI)

A few things over several sections of this chapter were a little off-putting or disturbing.

First, fanboying over Larry Page of Google, and how he "shattered the stereotypes" of billionaires being pompous and arrogant, when they met and then proceeding to describe the interaction in the tone of someone from the "out group" being given attention by an "in group" member, talking about cocktail party meetups and "spirited debates", how their wives were friends and name dropping Elon Musk in there- was actually pretty disgusting.

I'm sure Larry is an amazing person, he has certainly achieved a lot and is obviously a very smart person. But the guy writing this book, gushing about this person who would have some big conflicts of interest being in the privileged and billionaire class, and here is the author gushing about him and his significance in the world- hard to overlook.

Regarding the FLI, he goes on to say this institute brought the best and brightest minds in AI together, in an exclusive meetup to basically discuss the fate of the future AI superpower, located it in a beach resort in Puerto Rico and _"...banned the media from attending."_.

Not that I'm a big fan of the media given the existing and corrupt, systemic power structures we all know can be arms of the ruling class, but several things about how this FLI goes about things just reeks of the elite, privileged class organizing themselves (and who they deem "worthy") around future power sources and controls, and at the same time using words like "benevolent" and trying convince everyone it's all for the good of everyone.

Sure.

At least this important insight from their "members only" meetup in Puerto Rico:

>_"..we might build technology power enough to permanently end these scourges(poverty,disease and war)-- or to end humanity itself. We might create societies that flourish like never before, on Earth and perhaps beyond, or a Kafkaesque global surveillance state so powerful that it could never be toppled"_

## Chapter 2: Matter Turns Intelligent

### Definition of Intelligence

Broad definition of Intelligence = _"The ability to accomplish complex goals"_.

The difference between _Broad_ and _Narrow_ intelligence, examples IBM Deep Blue chess computer is has "narrow" intelligence, it can only do one thing really well, pull up a game of tic-tac-toe it's not-so-good at it. Googles DeepMind can play a dozen Atari games at human-level or better skill, it has "broad" intelligence.

Then human intelligence is "uniquely broad" in that we can learn and master a very wide range of different skills. Deep Blue is _one_ thing, and that's chess. DeepMind is a doz things, but its only games- can it cook a steak? No, no it can't.

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

The holy grail of AI research, AGI. Is "maximally broad- able to accomplish any goal, including learning.".

AI accomplishing goals, at this stage of the definition, is "value-neutral"- it doesn't "care" whether the goals is "good" or "bad".
