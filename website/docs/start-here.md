## Talofa ðŸ‘‹

That means "hello" in Samoan.

This is my make-shift [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) ðŸŒ± where I try to write regularly, learn in public and share the thought-process.

## ðŸ—’ Notes

My notes will be on random, ad-hoc things I'm working on at any one time, but will mostly involve cloud, kubernetes, devops, automation, security.

The sidebar menu and documents will grow as I continue to add more notes to the garden.

## Currently...

What you can find in my garden:

### ðŸ“š [Books](books/reading-list.md)

My reading list, what I'm currently reading and notes on books I've read.

### ðŸ“— Study

Study and exam notes for certifications, courses.

I sat and passed my CKS in 09-2021. All my study and exam notes are [here](study/CKS/README.md).

### ðŸ’» [Technology](technology/index.md)

Where all the technology notes live...

### ðŸ—ƒ Archive

Old blog posts from 2016-2020.
