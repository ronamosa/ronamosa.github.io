## Talofa 👋

That means "hello" in Samoan.

This is my make-shift [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) 🌱 where I try to write regularly, learn in public and share the thought-process.

## 🗒 Notes

My notes will be on random, ad-hoc things I'm working on at any one time, but will mostly involve cloud, kubernetes, devops, automation, security.

The sidebar menu and documents will grow as I continue to add more notes to the garden.

### HackTheBox

I started on HackTheBox on March-15-2022 and will post write-ups of my hacking efforts here as well.

### Twitch

I do a hacking stream at [https://www.twitch.tv/RxHackk](https://www.twitch.tv/rxhackk) where I hack on TryHackme or HackTheBox machines and do my best to follow ['swyx'](https://www.swyx.io/about) philosophy of ["learning in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).
