## Talofa ðŸ‘‹

That means "hello" in Samoan.

This is my make-shift [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) ðŸŒ± where I try to write regularly, learn in public and share the thought-process.

## Notes

I will mostly focus on various technologies I'm interested in such as cloud, kubernetes, containers, devops and security. The sidebar menu and documents will grow as I continue to add more notes to the garden.

I will also make notes from books I'm reading on my [reading list](books/reading-list) ðŸ“š.

### Top of mind notes
