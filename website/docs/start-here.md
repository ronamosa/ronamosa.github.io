## Talofa 👋

That means "hello" in Samoan.

This is my make-shift [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) 🌱 where I try to write regularly, learn in public and share the thought-process.

## 🗒 Notes

My notes will be on random, ad-hoc things I'm working on at any one time, but will mostly involve cloud, kubernetes, devops, automation, security.

The sidebar menu and documents will grow as I continue to add more notes to the garden.
