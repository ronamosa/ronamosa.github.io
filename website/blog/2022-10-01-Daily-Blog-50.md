As busy and hectic as life can get, do your best not to get *"lost in the sauce"*.

It's easy to do when you're in a new space doing your best to get good in that space. 

You forget the spaces you've already been, and got good in.

So, don't forget everything you've been through, that's brought you to the start of the new space.

> 'I am I and my circumstance; and, if I do not save it, I do not save myself.' Jos√© Ortega y Gasset.

You get more of what you focus on, so make sure "you" are still in the picture.

If you do what everyone else is doing, you'll have what everyone else has- is that what you want?

Stay focused in the sauce.
