Change is slow.

Change is painful (not necessarily physically).

Change is the only constant. Cliche. Apt.

I re-enabled social media blocking extensions in my browers.

My mind races less. Not a lot less, but less cos I can't access that dopamine hit relief I'm looking for when coming up with words to my writing gets... uncomfortable.

That was a good change. Painful. But good.

Change has to happen and something needs to Change.

Change is an Action. Not a feeling. Not a word.

It's a doing.

It's never done.

It's the transition period between before and after, and is never "still".

When it's no longer happening, it's nothing. It doesn't exist.

As long as we're alive, we're changing ever second. We're wearing out. Deprecating.

When we physically stop changing, we no longer exist.

But we can be non existent long before we're dead.
