The Buddha says *"Desire is the root of suffering"* and stocism, via Epictetus says *"Freedom isn't secured by filling up on your hearts desires but by removing desire.".*

We feel some sort of pain, loss or lacking when we desire something. Desiring meaning it's not within our means, whatever those "means" need be to acquire the object of our desire. So we have no object, but only the desire of it.

And the space between what we have, and what we don't have, is desire.

How useless. And knowing it's of no use to us, why keep it? Throw it away, be done with it and push it aside.

It serves you in no good way, so if you must lose something in the time from now, til then- lose the desire to suffer.
