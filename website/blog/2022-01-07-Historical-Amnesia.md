"Historical amnesia is a dangerous phenomenon not only because it
undermines moral and intellectual integrity but also because it lays the
groundwork for crimes that still lie ahead." - _Who Rules the World?_ by Noam
Chomsky.

Among many other (probably more) quotable passages from the book, this one stood out to me this morning.

Probably in the same vein as "controlling the narrative", it's about the stories we tell ourselves- about ourselves, that can project or forecast what potential "good" or "evil" lies ahead.

I don't have any great insights on this other than remembering the
objective facts about our past- not dwelling on them or being
paralyzed by them- can help keep our moral and intellectual integrity
about them.

And probably safeguard us from repeating any of our not-so-great
history, into the future.
