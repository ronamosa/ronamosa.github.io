>_"Trust the Process"_

Often times it feels like you've been on the road, on the journey towards your destination, and you're wondering if anything is happening. You're wondering if you're making progress, if you're getting anywhere.

And this is normal to feel after a short time, because you haven't built up the stamina, the conditioning, for the work you're doing.

Just like physical fitness, you run 1km and feel like that's the longest distance in the world. But (and this is the hard part) if you show up, every day, and put add 100m to that 1km, you'll be running at least 36km by the end of the year.

Just a little reminder, keep turning up, doing the work, and one of two things will happen- you'll reach your destination or at the very least you'll learn a lot about yourself and the world around you.

Keep going.
