30 posts in a row, never missing a day.

I have come full circle. But just like a circle, there is no beginning and no end.

Yes, celebrate the little milestone of commitment, but essentially, we keep moving on.

Nice work on 30 posts in 30 days. It shows you can do what you commit yourself to. Just show up every day and write something.

Now, a newsletter is going to be a lot more thoughtful, but at least I know how to show up and `git push` posts to be published.

No profound wisdom tonight. Just gratitude, and humility that this is a small thing- a good thing, but that it's nothing to pull over and go to sleep over.

It's nice. This was nice.

The only time I don't mind having gone, in a circle.
