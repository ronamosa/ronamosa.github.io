A wise man once said "Discipline equals freedom" (I'm sure a dark "work sets you free" parallel can be found here, but let's stay focused).

Getting up at 5am to walk and do pushups is not "fun". It's not the most difficult thing to do in the world, but it's not easy either.

But in doing the hard things, conditioning your mind, body and spirit, you make life *lighter*.

Whether that means you just feel good, and optimistic going into your busy schedule and hectic lifestyle.

Or, you realise you don't actually need, or even want the things that are taking up all your time-

Doing the hard things is like fire, if you're exposed to it momentarily it burns away the loose, scraggly ends of your existence and leaves behind what was strong enough to withstand it and remain unaffected.

Do the hard things.
