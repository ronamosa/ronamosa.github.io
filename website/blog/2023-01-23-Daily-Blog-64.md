Time is an [illusion](https://ronamosa.io/blog/2023/01/22/Daily-Blog-63).

Containers of activity or inactivity, demarcated by linear units of measurement.

We judge the quality of these containers, by the activities we fill them with, and then decide if we are happy about it or not.

We only have so many containers, and we can only do so many activities. Non activities are infinite, but the number of containers remain finite.

Time is going to pass us anyway so you may as well fill your containers with the activities that make you happy & fulfilled.
