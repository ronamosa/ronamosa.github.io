My newsletter, or the one tech "me" thing I've set for myself, my little reprieve from "work tech" and "tech for others", is my little ["totem"](https://inception.fandom.com/wiki/Totem) that tells me things are still manageable.

When my "thing" slips, due to whatever, lack of motivation, lack of energy, lack of time - all those things just point me to "where have those things gone to?" and "why wasn't my thing a priority.

Because in the grand scheme of things, my "thing" isn't that big of a deal. It's 4-5 hours total effort time, to ideate, write, revise and proof a newsletter article.

If I don't have time/energy/space/care for that, every week, I'm doing something wrong.

And it needs to be addressed.
