They say _"hard work beats talent, when talent doesn't work hard enough"._

The "hard work" in that saying is the boring part.

I've known plenty of talented people who didn't work very hard, they enjoyed being able to pass the mark by showing up on the day.

No training. No study.

Little work for a lot of reward.

The thing, these people are from a very long time ago when I was young, a teenager even. And maybe time and maturity gives you a different lens to look through, but it's so obvious now that the "talented" way of life has a very short shelf life.

_"Time will make fools of us all"_ is a saying I just made up, because that's the thing that defeats all notions of the "talented way of life".

Between talent and hard work, the reality is both will be subject to _time_ (as we all are).

And talent over time is a law of diminishing returns. And that's not to say talent doesn't count for anything- of course it doesn't. Between two hard working people, the one with talent has the advantage. Between a lazy talent and a hard worker, time will crown the one who has put in the most work.

Turn up every day, work. The end.
