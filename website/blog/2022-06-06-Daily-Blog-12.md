Otherwise known as a compromise, or an accepted cost, risk or price.

Having an ideology is good, it helps guide your way. It lets you determine what's important and what's not.

But as nothing is perfect, the "rubber meeting the road" of living out an ideology, is where you deal with trade-offs.

Trade-offs are real, and I would argue, necessary.

They don't have to be a bad thing if you know who you are, and what you're doing.

I believe it's naive- even dangerous (to your cause), to stick so rigidly to your ideology that you become inflexible. Storms are a natural phenomenon of life, and a structure that is inflexible in a storm, doesn't bend- it breaks.

Some people see "compromise" as a dirty word. I see these types of people more invested in their personal crusades than the objective "whole" of the cause.

Sure, some would argue "holding fast" is for the greater good, in the long run.

They could well be right. Nobody knows what will happen in the future.

But in the meantime, what costs to you, your people and your cause are you willing to accept while waiting for the promise of that future you, and your people are holding out for?

Good.

Welcome to a trade off.
