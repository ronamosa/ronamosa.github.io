Given 6 hours to chop down a tree, Abhraham Lincoln would have spent four hours sharpening the axe.

On a new venture, an new idea, project it's tempting to dive straight into action.

Why not? It's the exciting part. Action speaks louder than works right? It's time to get sh!t done!

Yes. But more effectively, No.

If you work hard at the beginning, to learn, understand what it is you're trying to do, every action from there becomes more intentional, more informed and more calculated towards your specific goal or objective.

The tempation to allay the feeling of not "doing something", just fills time in with lower-value space where a higher value of "unit of work" could have been put there instead, given more time spent doing the "sharpening".

Invest in being a better learner, being a better do-er, before doing the "doing".
