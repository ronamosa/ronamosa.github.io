"Strong ideas, loosely held" is a concept revisiting my lexicon.

They say you should "find your tribe", but what do you do when you've searched high and low, far and wide, and you still haven't found them?

You travel alone.

_"Let people be themselves"_ is another phrase I've heard lately that resonates with how we travel in this life.

Instead of persuading people to be something you want, or you yourself becoming someone you're not- if you haven't found your tribe (yet) despite doing what you can to see and be seen by them, then you are where you're meant to be-

And you travel alone.

I know people need people, we're social animals.

So, travelling alone is a strong idea in the moment.

I don't mind holding it loosely.
