When you have lived long enough, you can look back and remember how many times you started again.

Another life, another relationship, another fitness program or schedule you used to keep.

I say "another" and not "a new", because by this stage *"e leai se mea fou i lalo le la"* (there is nothing new under the Sun).

You know what works for you, not because you've theorised it as a teenager, but you've done numerous seasons of this thing that got you the result and you've tweaked most of the "fat" off it, and it runs lean.

But you stopped doing it. For whatever reason.

So, we start again. Maybe this time reviewing our history, and helping the weight of that knowledge, those memories, help us forge it this time, in iron.
