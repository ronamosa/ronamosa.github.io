I had a listen to an interview on Google Talks with Tiago Forte about this idea of a "Second Brain".

He has a fascinating story and reason for researching and coming up with this idea. I believe I was delving into my digital garden and reassessing what I'm going to do with it, and how to maintain it.

I've use Obsdian in the past when learning Zettelkasten, all for the ultimate goal of disseminating all the information I was interested in and reading, and consuming, and trying to find a way to have it be usesful in my life in some way.

Well, it's that season again and I'm looking at all the knowledge, information and data that is available and interesting and trying to get myself re-organised around it.

I listened to a Twitter Space with Kelsey Hightower just this week about how he deals with all the cool new, fun, interesting and distracting tech that's around us, and how he goes about building up his engineering and technical skills & abilities.

He says he picks a few skills he wants to focus on, and then commits to learning only those while being aware of the rest, but leaving them for another time.

Focus.

So, I may (probably will) take a page from Kelseys book and pick a few things I really, really want to upskill on, and focus on those for now.

I don't think that stops me reading and making notes on topics I'm interested in, but in terms of skills building, I'm going to do the focus route.
