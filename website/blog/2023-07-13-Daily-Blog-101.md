In the beginning there was the word.

Maybe before there was anything, you had to sit there and talk to yourself until those things you were talking came into existence.

You sit here talking into the void.

But you can't be intermittent with it, it's not like a cumulative thing, that adds up and eventually topples things over.

It's a pressure. It needs to build up.

Like a critical mass, until it is overwhelming.

So speak into the void, every day until from the void comes the world.
