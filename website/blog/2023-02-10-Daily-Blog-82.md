Audience is your "who". The intention of your external actions and activities.

How do the audience know this thing, this action, is for them?

A wise friend once said to me, you don't choose your audience, your audience chooses you.

If you're confused, your audience, whoever they understand themselves to me, will also be confused.

Your audience chooses you, when you allow yourself to be "you".

So, in a very zen-like way, you, are your audience.

And maybe that's why people are so afraid to be themselves. They may come face to face with the reality they don't really like this show, this storyline.

But therein lies the value and opportunity to address something real.

You can change what you don't like, or you can resolve why you don't like your _self_.

I think once you find yourself, your real self that you can accept and be at peace with, you find your audience.
