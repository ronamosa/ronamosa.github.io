This could also have been called "The Pain of Knowing".

When you've experienced something, you've lived it. You know how it went, how it felt, deeper than any words could ever express the full experience of having done "the thing".

*"There's something to be said for experience"* is a phrase any young people coming into the work force may be able to relate to. Because the experience is what they're lacking and usually leads the young person missing out on an opportunity.

But there *is* something to be said for experience.

Once you've experienced something (and YMMV), you "know" that thing.

Knowing isn't necessarily something you can put in words, or writing, but it's part of you now, like your DNA. And if you come across that situation again, something inside you will resonate with the external experience and call on the wisdom, that "knowing" to serve you in that moment.

All this to say, experience is valuable in ways a lot of people don't fully understand and keeps being the differentiator between the doors that open to you, and the ones that don't.

So however you can get it, the pain of doing needs to be got out there, and done.
