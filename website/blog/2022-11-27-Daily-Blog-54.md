_"Start as you mean to proceed..."_ is a saying I've been familiar with for a while now.

I just looked up the original quote, and it's _"Begin as you mean to go on"_. Same same.

I'll sometimes take some time before I start things. It's the battle between "just start" and this quote above.

There's diving recklessly into something and calling it "taking action", and there's never starting something and calling it "being smart" about something. Which is often time just being scared to fail, or fear of humiliation (of failure).

And I think the underlying element that renders both ends of that spectrum moot, is actually just figuring out what your intention with the thing is.

_"Why do you want to do this thing you're trying to do?"_

You get that clear, you're halfway there.
