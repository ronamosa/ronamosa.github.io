Life's not that serious. 

How can it be when we're mere ants on a rock hurtling through space?

The ultimate thing that happens to us, is we die. I was going to say ther worst thing is death- but the usual counter to that is often "there are worse things than death..." meaning torture, or a life of pain.

But ultimately, we ALL have death to look forward to. The end. Literally.

So, what is there to be so serious about?

I'm not saying to hedonistically throw your life around, and eventually _away_, I'm just saying life is exactly what we make of it.

And whatever that is, it ultimately doesn't actually matter.

So, don't sweat the small stuff.
