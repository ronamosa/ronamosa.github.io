Making things larger than they are is a great environment to feel pressure and "uncomfortableness" everywhere you go.

["Meditations"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations) by Marcus Aurelius talks about being in harmony with nature and that everything happens exactly as it should so why should we feel uncomfortable with things as they happen?

<!-- truncate -->

The idea being to accept that "it is what it is" and things are what they are- so who are we to feel out of sorts about it? If and where we do is an exercise in us changing ourselves to meet the world where it is. And not participate in the futile endeavour of wishing that things were different. This would only cause us distress, and further our "suffering" at the hands of our own perspectives of the world.

Your perspective is within your control, so you can change it at will. And it would benefit you to do so, as quickly as the opportunity (and your ego) requires it.

When you find yourself uncomfortable- ask yourself "why?". Seek understanding. Seek wisdom.

Embrace change. Give yourself grace to allow time to grow and evolve to where you have no need to feel any fear, for no situation need be uncomfortable any longer than you allow it.
