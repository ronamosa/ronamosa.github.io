Just saw a video where someone was describing the act of writing a blog post, or an instagram caption, just writing something, publicly, every day was not the act necessarily of having something to say. but that the act allowed you to realise what it is you have to say.

I might have lost track of that. I tend to, once outside influences come into the picture, compliments, conversations, opinions from other, and even just my own instrusive thoughts from an outside perspective.

all irrelevant and honestly detrimental, to the process and the practice, of sitting myself down, coming into my own space (physically and mentally), and having that conversation with myself to figure out *what* I have to say.

I have so many thoughts that come to the fore every day, that I need to just come straight to the blog, and post the one that makes it to the front.
