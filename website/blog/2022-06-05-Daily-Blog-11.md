One of my mum's favourite sayings to us growing up was "Time and Tide wait for no man".

This brilliant video, an illustration of an Alan Watts monologue entitled ["The Illusion of Money, Time and Ego"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYSQ1NF1hvw) brought this saying back to mind.

"Time and tide..." one a mental construct, the other a physical phenomenon of nature.

And neither of them wait for you.

They both keep marching on, and the only thing that distinguishes this point in a timeline, from one in the future, is what happens in it i.e. what you do.

So, maybe "get busy living".
