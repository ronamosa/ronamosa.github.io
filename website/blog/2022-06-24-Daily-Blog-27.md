Long-term thinking.

The phrase goes "take it one day at at time". Which is great advice, really is.

It means to focus on the "single step" in saying *"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step"*. To not take on any more than that, because why would you? What does taking on more than is necessary accomplish?

It's certainly not efficient, or sustainable.

You take it one day at a time, like you focus on the single steps that make up the thousand mile journey.

So too you see, that today is one day in forever- not *your* forever- just forever.

That were you to frame, this day, in *your* life, against the backdrop of the infiniteness (as far as we know) of the universe- and everything that came before you, and will come to be and pass long after you're gone- you would live your life accordingly in humility, gratitude and freedom from the lanes, actions and ambitions of others**.

Your one day, live it now, live it wisely.

That it pales in any real significance against the inifite helps you not to take it too seriously.

***caveats obviously.*
