If your efforts today didn't meet the imaginary mark in your head. Take the lesson. Always take the lesson. Because it will always, always be there. The result you wanted is never guaranteed - hoped for, possibly expected - but never guaranteed.

Write things down, in goal setting it makes it real, practical, daily. In reflection of an effort not resulting in what you had hoped for, write it down. Reflect on it. It's hard to do that in your head, write it down, bring it into this realm, confront it, learn from it.
