Nobody cares. Do it anyway.

It's a thought that needs to be repeated. Daily. Hourly?

That we are insignificant in the grandest scheme of things. That isn't a diminishing, or demeaning concept or way of thinking of oneself. But a liberation from the most inane sense of grandiosity that imprisons us and our "true" selves to exist and live out our purpose.

And the purpose is not "grand". It just is _is_. End of.

Everything we ever needed to be who we were meant to be, was inside us all along.

Do it anyway. Nobody cares.
