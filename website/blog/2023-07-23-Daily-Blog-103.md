maybe the machines make us unhappy.

the machine appeared in a time that had a void, a hole in the matrix.

the machine filled that need. it was consistently present (unless you'd b0rked it yourself), and would give as much as you could ask.

but we're not machines. as much as we'd like to be.

avoid the messy bits. cold hard logic.

easy.

lifeless.

the next best thing is we have the machines around.

we rely a lot on them, to give us what we're missing.

maybe the machines make us unhappy.
