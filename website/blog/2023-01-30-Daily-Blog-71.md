Going against the grain is never easy.

It's easier to go with what everyone else is doing and not upset the status quo, to not stand out.

Eric Hoffer talks about the aggravation that "freedom" gives us in ["The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15916.The_True_Believer), placing _"...the whole blame of failure on the shoulder of the individual"_.

When we get to think for ourselves, we are liberated, but we are also subject to what those thoughts bring us. Responsibility? Obligation? It's no wonder then that people will go with the crowd, or keep their unpopular opinions to themselves lest they are challenged on it.

And we repeat this, in our lives, in our families, on and on, for generations.

But the unpopular thing, the "different" thing, is the only thing that will bring about change. You can't keep doing the same thing over and over and expect different results- the definition of insanity.

Unpopular thinking and action is necessary for change. Bert Hellinger's ["The Black Sheep"](http://www.lobatotherapy.com/blog/2020/2/4/jjno6iyjochcucmxc0hlp2bq9gs196) sees these characters in the family tree, _"criticized, judged and even rejected"_ as being the ones that will actually _"free the tree from repetitive stories that frustrate entire generations."_. Without you going against the grain, the unfulfilled dreams of your ancestors who couldn't go against the grain _"would die buried beneath their own roots"_.

It's a sobering thought, that you carry this opportunity with you, to realise not only a change for yourself, but for your ancestors who wanted so much more for themselves, the family tree, and you.

Be unpopular.
