The famous Batman quote:

> *"You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"*

To me, says "overshooting the mark" or losing your way.

I know a "once great" man, who was a master of his craft, and year in, year out, he couldn't miss.

Nowadays he can't seem to hit anything at any time.

<!-- truncate -->

Some people believe we have a set time under "God's grace". A time where you live a charmed life and everything you touch turns to gold.

But, when this time is up, you're out of "God's favour" and no matter how hard you try, it's over. Done.

Deterministic, yes.

The explanation is superficial. Watching this person I know, descend into what could easily be describe as "madness", in pursuit of a former glory, or ability.

It's sad. We look for explanations. But this doesn't change anything.

Maybe he'll see he doesn't need to be a hero.

That he never was, and that's okay.

Just don't die a villian.
