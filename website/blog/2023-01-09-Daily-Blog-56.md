With so much knowledge and information available at your fingertips you'd be forgiven for wanting to stand _behind_ the shoulders of giants, instead of on _top_ of those shoulders.

In looking into personal knowledge management systems over the past few weeks, I've learned (and probably should know this by now) that the purpose of consuming all this information and knowledge from various sources, is not to then regurtitate the same knowledge. But instead to process it, taking it through your specific and unique filter and "computer", to then produce a new idea, or perspective or piece of information to contribute back to the topic.

It's a vulnerable position to put yourself in, to offer something that is _your own thoughts_ to be examined, critiqued and possibly ridiculed by others. But therein lies the work: for yourself to be okay with thinking your own thoughts, and then sharing them with the humility of someone who's here to learn and share what they've learned.
