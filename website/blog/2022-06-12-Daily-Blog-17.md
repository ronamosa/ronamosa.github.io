"Geographicals" in AA terms is just changing location without changing yourself.

Or worse, changing location *hoping* this would change your 'self'.

But there is no change unless you choose to, and a change of scenery is just that- scenery. But with the same storylines, with the same plot holes.

Because everywhere you go, "there you are".

If you're going to go anywhere, go "inside".

Change self. Change world.
