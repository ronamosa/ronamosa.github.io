Sometimes things work out in your favour. A lot of the time, it doesn't.

Neither of these times last, and we'd do well to remember that.

When the going gets tough, keep going! A tough phase is not where you want to stop.

Get your mind right, invest in activities to boost those good internal signals e.g. eat something healthy, drink water, go for a walk, touch grass, feel the sun on your skin.

At the end of the day, believe in tomorrow. Tomorrows another day, another chance to be just that little bit better than you were today, in skills, in happiness, in life.

It's always darkest before the dawn.
