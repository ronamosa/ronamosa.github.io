Talofa reader,

This is going to be my last weekly newsletter for now as I’m going to switch this to monthly.

<!-- truncate -->

And maybe some ad-hoc ones every now and then.

I’ve been busying myself trying to get one more big thought piece out before I switch - this one dealing with “thought leadership in the Pasifika tech space” - but it’s still a long-ass set of ideas and anecdotes at the moment and I think I’m going to go to bed before midnight instead.

I’m going to switch the cadence up for a couple of reasons.

Firstly, writing these pieces at the length I want to discuss and explore the ideas and thoughts, but also make sure it makes sense and doesn’t descend into mindless ramblings (you can find that on my blog) - take a bit of effort and time.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s been a great exercise so far in what I started it out for, especially for someone who doesn’t consider themselves a writer.

It’s kind of like me and running.

I know it’s good for me, and it doesn’t kill me to do it, but I’m always glad once it’s over.

And secondly, I realised the time and effort I’ve been putting in to putting this out weekly is taking away from doing something I really*really*enjoy - which is tech stuff, building and breaking stuff.

I’m working on a new “thing” (this list will never stop growing) which will be more tech & building things, and then once a month I’ll aim my brain at some words and write a long-form piece about the state of the Pasifika tech world.

Thanks to everyone who’s subscribed and sent me messages, I’ve enjoyed reading them.

I appreciate you all 🙏🏽

This isn’t goodbye, it’s see you once a month.
