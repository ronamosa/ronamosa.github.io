I asked ChatGPT what the difference between the term AI (Artificial Intelligence) we're commonly used to, and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) that we hear more now when talking about AI, and it gave me a really good analogy about a hammer and a toolbox.

>_AI is like a hammer, great at one type of thing. AGI is a toolbox, has many tools for many different jobs._

And tools are how we progressed as a species, tools have been used to build things that made our lives better, easier. But we've also been used to build  things that harmed us and made life worse.

It's ironic that ChatGPT uses the term "thing" and "jobs" when explaining what AI and AGI should be looked at.

Because ChatGPT is right, it's a tool. It's neutral. The onus is on _us_ to decide if the "thing" and "job" we're using it for, is for humanity's good, or demise.
