When you're doing something hard, something that hasn't been done before, and you're working within constraints, limitations both practical and political - you need belief.

Belief doesn't excuse you from corporate and political realities of delivering capitalist value from nothing, or next to nothing. In fact finding yourself in a position where "belief in the mission, in oneself" is even more reason to double down and ensure you maintain that belief.

What does Hebrews 11:1 say about faith? It's the "substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen".

You're now in the business of manifesting things out of the spirit world, into reality. This is not as crazy as it sounds, many notable people in history have done exactly this.

When you're in this realm, yes you have to execute with strategy and precision, but the currency, the life-blood of this venture - is belief (or faith).

Keep the faith, stay in the game until the nothing is made manifest into something.
