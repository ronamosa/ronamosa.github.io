The "you don't have to be technical to work in tech." line never sat right with me.

Yes, a lot of different roles in the tech space for sure, Project Manager, Product Owner, Design etc. It wasn't the "we have lots of career choices" angle that felt off to me, it was the gold-rush vibe of rushing people over here cos the money was/is good.

Gold rushes are dangerous for those who don't know how gold rushes work, and don't know history.

As much as I want more Pasifika in technology, I understand like with _any_ demographic, this industry may not be that interesting to you, so it's gonna be a teeth-pulling experience at best if that's you.

And here's the thing, you don't have to come to tech. It's an option, yes. Check it out, see if you want to exchange the effort for reward, if that reward is for you, your family or community- then by all means.

But understand how this gold rush works, and then prepare for the lessons from history.
