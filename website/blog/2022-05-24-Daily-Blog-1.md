Intention and Focus sound like two parts that make up the idea of "Drive", as in ambition, direction.

And that's a good place to start when restarting something like this blog.

I went back to the start of why this blog exists. What is it for? *Who* is it for?

And that lead me to Seth Godin (again)...

<!--truncate-->

Seth has written his [blog](https://seths.blog/) every day without fail since 1995.

He's written 7000+ blog posts. And his motivation is to write something every day. Not because he feels like it, or is inspired, but that he turns up, and writes, every day.

> What's my intention with this blog?

To practice and discipline myself to turn up and commit to writing something, anything and post it- ***every day***.

> What's my focus?

This may change, but I want to write about ideas. I don't want this to turn into a throwaway "dear diary" blog, but at least *one* idea I have in my mind at the time.

So that's it.

Seth made the decision "one time", and hasn't looked back since. At least *one* blog post a day, every day.

Lessshgo.
