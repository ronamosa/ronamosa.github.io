> _"You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems" - Jame Clear_

It's funny what a difference in routine makes. On the 15th of Feb I travelled to another country for week for work. Out of my routine, out of my disciplines and haven't written a blog since.

All we are, are a series of systems that end up producing things, so if you don't like the things you're producing (if anything at all) your best bet is to work on the machine, the systems that are producing the results you're living with.

What's top of mind as I come back into my "at home" environment? Routines and products i.e. what am I doing every day? And what is that producing for me? Am I more peaceful? Stressed? Tired? Thoughtful?

I travel regularly for work. That's a reality of my role. So I need to find a routine that produces the things I want in my life, even when on the road.
