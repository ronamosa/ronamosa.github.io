I wrote "the standard you walk past is the standard you accept" by Lt General Morrison in a piece of writing recently.

In my experience, if you want something done to a high level, not just in *what* is done, but in *how* it's done as well - you'll soon find yourself in a very small group of people that are afflicted by the same condition.

I'm not talking about perfectionism, this is where you find it difficult and even repugnant to half-ass something you put your hand to. If you delivered that best you could do at the time, that's okay. It's "calling it in" that you find offensive.

You get used to the isolating effect of maintaining a high standard, or you compromise and find the median level in life and stand "in".
