Sometimes it's just nice to *not* have a thought in your head.

23:16 as I write this, and the George Addair quote "everything you've ever wanted is sitting on the other side of fear."

Just thinking about that tonight, what would we all be, if fear and insecurity wasn't a thing. That we just did what made us happy, navigated what we needed to do, and just lived our lives.

Maybe some people just have this mode without any effort at all, and then some people need the daily ritual to get here.

Either way, this has to be the north star - getting to this state - because then you can begin, living your life the way that makes you happy, the way you want, right up until you need to remember this again.

Rinse, repeat.
