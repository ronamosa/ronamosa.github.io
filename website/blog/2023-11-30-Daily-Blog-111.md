What's my "why?" is what I was thinking when I wrote the title and promptly forgot to come back and finish this thought.

I force myself to write a "Daily Thought" which is rarely daily, and often times barely passes as any real thought when writing things out.

Why?

Time. Focus. Priorities. All the excuses.

Forever thinking of another way to get to the same goal, without even finish seeing through the last 3-4 ideas to some level of feedback or experience.

Why?

It's almost 11pm on a Friday night, on the 1st even though this will be dated the 30th, and I need to cut it off here and go do another thing I've told myself is the "priority" now.

Why? I don't know. Well I do, but I'm out of time.
