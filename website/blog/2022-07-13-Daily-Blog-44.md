Hard things are hard.

If you're not conditioned to the activity, you get tired quick.

If you quit then, you'll only ever know and be able to tolerate that level of activity.

But you press on, you come back, you try again- now you get a chance to get a little bit better.

You try again, gain a little bit more.

That's it. That's the post. Tomorrow and the end result you want, is not promised.

The only promise is you try today, you gain something, in that moment, today.

Live to fight another day.

Resilience.
