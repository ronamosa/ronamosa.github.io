> _"Systems not goals"_

to summarize James Clears philosophy from ["Atomic Habits"](https://jamesclear.com/goals-systems). Daily habits and routines that push me towards the person and things I want in my life. And not the focus on far away destinations that I someday hope to reach.

We announce things in the future, "this is coming" or "I'm working on this". But what about what's happening _now_? What are we doing in the meantime?

We're all familiar with the cliche _"It's about the journey, not the destination"_ but announce goals and don't say much about the daily challenges, routines and wins that accompany the journey.

Maybe it's not exciting enough? Maybe we've gotten the dopamine hit from announcing the grand thing?

I thinks it's the difference between announcing "We are going to win the championship!" and "We are going to hit the gym and train every day!". One looks like an awesome destination, a goal to be excited about. The other one sounds more like "work".

But you can have the second one without the first. You can't have the first one without the second. Maybe we should all get more excited about the _work_ and not the goal. Because we know the committing to the work always pays off.

Even when it doesn't result in the goal.
