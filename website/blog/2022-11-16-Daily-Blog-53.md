Picking a lane and sticking to it.

Not for anything external, go inwards.

Focus. Discipline. Purpose.

> "Comparison is the thief of joy."

If you're only focused on your lane, you can only compare yourself to your previous self.

That's where you want to be.

Whichever lane you decide on. Stay in it.
