I just wanted to send you a note to say, thank you, for valuing access to my writing enough to part with your hard-earned money…

And to let you know there’s more writing in the pipeline, it’s just been competing with several other things that require brain-space, which, as smart as I think I am, is still limited lol.

If there’s a particular topic you’d be interested in hearing me speak on, or explore, please feel free to contact me, I’m open to ideas.

Also, I’m gonna try the podcast thing soon- which will just be me reading the post out, so you can hear it how I mean it to sound :)

til the next one,

Ron.
