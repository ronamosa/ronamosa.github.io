Talofa reader,

It’s February already, but happy 2025, and gong xi fa chai 🐍 all the same!

This isn’t an actual post, but more of a “hey, checking in and letting you know I’ve got somerantswriting coming!”

This is already shaping up to be a weird year, what with everything going on in AI, U.S. Politics, our shitty politics and just the overall decline of human society (😂😭).

<!-- truncate -->

My outlook and goals this year (as usual) are a bit chaotic, but I’m getting better at just accepting that, having a bias for action, but also be willing to axe something that doesn’t feel “right”. This could be seen as “fickle”, I know, but I think with enough years of life experience, it’s hard to bullshit myself into thinking I like something I know I clearly don’t.

Would you look at that, the “just checking in post” is starting to turn into a “let me speak on a few things while I have your attention”.

Anyway, while I have you (lol), just quickly, this year- leaning into AI hard, building things, posting things, presenting things, community things, business things and also, possibly mype’a, and some aganu’u, and a few AI/ML certifications.

Lots on, dot com.

Talk soon,

Manuia feau ma galuega o le aso!

p.s. I’ve had a few youngin’s hit me up lately for tech career advice, and I tend to get a few of these requests throughout the year. I sent them this post from last year, which is still as true today as it was when I wrote it.

And, not just for pasifika, but imho, anyone, who’s not a complete sycophant for the corporation-

Have a read (it’s free), pass it on to anyone you think needs to read this (remember: Wu-Tang is for the kids)
