I've been doing this thing a little while now, and maybe it's my own personal expectations.

My voice is still echoing in here.

In these rooms I'm building, and these spaces I'm creating, my voice still echoes.

I'm a big believer in "the game", if things aren't working, figure it out, ask questions, take a step back etc.

At some point the question must be asked, "am I doing the wrong thing? is this not the path for me?".

Checking myself, am I looking for gratitude? acknowledgement? acceptance?

I'm human, so these would be nice, but really checking within- the only thing that makes any effort worthwhile....

is impact.

Otherwise, this is just recreation, and I have better things to do for recreation than this.

The echo is my voice, my effort, my offering, coming back to me, unused, unfulfilled.
