"We are what we repeatedly do… therefore excellence is not an act, but a habit.”  -- Will Durant.

I think every every night, or at the end of every day, a thought can be written down. I can write something down at the end of the day. A summary, or reflection.

A thought.

No based on being anything. Just thoughts, ideas, musings, reflections.

But public? Yeah why not. These aren't secrets. They're just thoughts and ideas, shared so they test the edges between comfort and honesty.

How honest or real am I being about this thought? Am I posturing? Playing up because people are watching?
Doing it for the likes? The reception?

What if it's just this, just a plain thought we've all heard before? Does it matter.

Maybe I build on these, day by day, and on a weekly basis, these collection of thoughts make the one big "idea" that is the weekly newsletter?

I think the point is, that it doesn't matter. That I just build the habit -- not via, 90+ subscribers on a substack, but at the end of every day, reflect a thought onto this blog.

I don't think the actual blog will matter, the content that is, but this act of sitting here, pushing those external voices, and pressure from my mind, and just write my thought out simply, and unadulterated.

Let's try that.
