Nipsey "Do you know how kids spell love? T.I.M.E."

One of the greatest gifts you can give someone, is your time.

Time is money. Why do they say this?

Waste time, me. Ok. But someone wastes my time? Unacceptable.

Time is a construct.

Good things take time. Study takes time. Getting good, takes time. If you see someone is good at something, they have paid a valuable price for that. Time.
Respect peoples time. Island time?

Time it takes to build relationships.
