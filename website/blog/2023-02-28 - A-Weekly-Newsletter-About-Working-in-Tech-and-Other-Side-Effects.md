Talofa reader,

## Let’s start at the beginning...

This isn’t my first rodeo, or newsletter. I started a newsletter back in 2018 and ran it for several editions before it got lost somewhere and came to it’s inevitable end.

It’s always hard starting something back up again, but if experience has taught me anything, it’s that once it’s up and running it’s not that bad.

Like going to the gym. The first few weeks are probably going to be painful, but if you stick at it, eventually it sucks a little less each time.

### Why am I starting a newsletter?

Believe it or not, it’s not to be a writer.

<!-- truncate -->

For as long as I can remember I loved consuming information to learn and know about things. I’ve got random trivia and useless knowledge for days. But I never feel like I really*know*anything that well, I just have a general idea about a lot of things.

The last time I felt like I genuinely understood something well was back at University when I had no choice but to*focus*on a subject, week in and week out, listening to lectures about it, writing about it and then getting examined.

I want to try some of that focus and commitment to reading thoughtfully and deliberately and then writing something about it. Every week. In a newsletter.

A weekly newsletter might be a bit ambitious, sure, but if I can build a discipline of reading with my brain engaged, and then producing a piece of writing that shows an understanding of that topic, I really don’t see a downside.

### Who might be interested in my newsletter?

Good question.

Are you interested in Cloud Infrastructure & Technology? DevSecOps? CICD & Automation? IT Architecture? Hacking & Cyber Security? AI? Crypto? Linux and Containers?

Cool.

Are you interested in how these technologies, and the careers and economics they bring, impact Pasifika people and communities in both positive and negative ways?

Great.

Might you also be interested in the views and opinions of someone, who identifies as Pasifika, and has worked in tech for almost two decades, local and overseas, with experience across several technical roles and also worked in a couple of Fortune 500 companies?

Awesome!

This newsletter probably has something in it for you.

### Where and When?

I will publish a newsletter weekly on Tues mornings.

I don’t have any plans for paid subscriptions like I said this is a thought-wrangling and writing exercise for my untamed brain.

You all get the pleasure of coming along for the ride.

So, if this all sounds like a bit of you every week…

and we’ll see you in the next episode 😊🙏🏽
