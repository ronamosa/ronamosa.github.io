At least not if your goal is for everyone who hears you to understand your position.

Or ultimately does he have a responsibility to society at large to do what's, on balance, the best for everyone? I would argue that the weight of this responsibility would shift as he scales up. Does the money and notoriety mean a shift in values? A \"reimagining\" of what integrity means /s?
