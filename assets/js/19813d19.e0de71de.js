Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users.\n\n\n\nPage: Cloud computing security\nSummary: Cloud computing security or, more simply, cloud security, refers to a broad set of policies, technologies, applications, and controls utilized to protect virtualized IP, data, applications, services, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing. It is a sub-domain of computer security, network security, and, more broadly, information security.\n\nPage: Cloud-native computing\nSummary: Cloud native computing is an approach in software development that utilizes cloud computing to "build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds". These technologies such as containers, microservices, serverless functions, cloud native processors and immutable infrastructure, deployed via \ndeclarative code are common elements of this architectural style. Cloud native technologies focus on minimizing users\' operational burden.Cloud native techniques "enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil."Frequently, cloud-native applications are built as a set of microservices that run in Open Container Initiative compliant containers, such as Containerd, and may be orchestrated in Kubernetes and managed and deployed using DevOps and Git CI workflows (although there is a large amount of competing open source that supports cloud-native development). The advantage of using containers is the ability to package all software needed to execute into one executable package. The container runs in a virtualized environment, which isolates the contained application from its environment. \n\n> Finished chain.\n'})}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"the-final-script",children:"The Final Script"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.pre,{children:(0,a.jsx)(t.code,{className:"language-plaintext",children:'"Introduction to Cloud Computing: Exploring the Benefits and Challenges"\n\nScript:\n\nHello and welcome to this YouTube video introduction to cloud computing. Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, such as data storage and computing power, to users without active management. It allows for cost savings, scalability, and efficiency - but it also brings new challenges.\n\nToday, we\u2019ll begin by exploring the benefits of cloud computing for users. We\u2019ll discuss the cost savings of cloud computing, as well as its scalability and efficiency. We\u2019ll then discuss the various cloud security measures (such as policies, technologies, and applications) that are used to protect data and applications.\n\nAfter that, we\u2019ll explore what cloud-native computing is. We\u2019ll talk about how it uses containers, microservices, and serverless functions to create scalability and minimize operational burden. We\u2019ll discuss how cloud-native can be deployed with declarative code and orchestrated in Kubernetes.\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll end by discussing some of the challenges that come with cloud computing, such as security concerns and data privacy.\n\nThat\u2019s it for the introduction to cloud computing.
