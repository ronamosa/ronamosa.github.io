We were the only Samoan family in a small farming town of about 1500 people, pretty much all palagi's (P\u0101keh\u0101). We spent 5 years behind enemy lines.. kidding, we all got along (eventually), and I actually look back fondly at that period in my life.

I played sports, I was in a band, and I hung out with people in real life. I was planning a career in the air force as a pilot right up until 7th form. But when a friend hacked my Dad's computer remotely while I was chatting with him that changed everything for me. After 7th form I went and (badly) attempted a BSc in CompSci at the University of Auckland and ended up dropping out. I then got my first tech role on the help desk of a small ISP in the city and over a 20 year period since then, transitioned to web development, then switched to applications support, then systems administration, unix engineering, cloud platform security and now solution architecture at a big tech firm."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"so-why-tech",children:"So, why tech?"}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"When my friend hacked my computer, he showed me his mastery of tech meant he had some level of control over things.

I wasn't interested in academics nor was I going to be a professional sports person. And I wasn't part of an affluent social group. But I liked solving the technical puzzles other people couldn\u2019t, or weren\u2019t interested in solving. Puzzles that unlocked knowledge of things, how to build them, how to break them.
