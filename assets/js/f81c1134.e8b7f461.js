No, it wasn\'t challenging\u2014it was full-on \\"masks off\\": power consolidation and imperial impunity on full display.\\n\\nYes, it\'s going to be one of those newsletters.\\n\\nIt\'s that wonderful, magical time of year where we get to reflect on everything that happened for us this year. The highs, the lows, the lessons learned and friends we made along the way. But in my heart of hearts, or at least if I\'m getting it one hundred, I don\'t feel that way. At all.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nIt\'s hard to put into words sometimes, the feeling I have when I look at everything around us. The economic position I\'ve lived in for so many years has shielded me and my family from much of what I see in the news\u2014the cost of living crisis, the housing shortage, the job market collapse.\\n\\nBut (believe it or not) I\'m human. I don\'t want to see people struggle for the basics, I don\'t want to see some people have nothing, while others have way more than they would ever need. And having another individually optimistic piece from some tech bro at Amazon is a little too on the nose for me.\\n\\nFortunately, I\'ve never been mistaken for an optimistic person, so you\'re going to get the complete opposite here. And I don\'t think being cynical or all \\"doom & gloom\\" is hot shit either. No-one\'s trying to be the cool contrarian guy here cause it\'s \\"edgy\\"\u2014those types have always been lame, they just didn\'t know it.\\n\\nI\'m going to say some things because a) it\'s genuinely how I feel about it and b) it\'s actually real and happening right now, and my position is- we can keep brushing past it with our head in the sand while it doesn\'t affect us \\"that much\\", or we can actually talk about it so I know where you stand (note: not wanting to talk about it, or acknowledge it, is 100% a position).\\n\\nWhat\'s this got to do with AI, CyberSecurity or Tech? In my opinion, everything.\\n\\nYou want examples? Look around aka get your head out of your ass:\\n\\nA handful of companies now control the entire AI landscape\u2014OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are [consolidating power](https://time.com/7322418/chat-gpt-open-ai-nvidia-tech-monopoly/) while extracting human creativity and labour at scale.

Does that feel like \\"survival of the company\\" actions, or pure extraction?\\n\\nHere in Aotearoa, our anti-M\u0101ori coalition government has done a bang-up job of the economy (note: sarcasm). [Bread is up 53%, milk up 16%, sirloin beef up 27%](https://business.scoop.co.nz/2025/12/16/national-is-making-life-more-expensive/). Nearly 200 Kiwis leave the country every day. The neoliberal project is delivering exactly what it\'s designed to: transfer wealth upward while working class and Pasifika communities pay for the privilege.\\n\\nGlobally, democratic institutions are collapsing in real-time.

[Another 2.5 million die yearly from fossil fuel air pollution](https://time.com/7329105/lancet-health-climate-impacts-2025/). The bodies stack up while we\'re still debating individual carbon footprints.\\n\\nWe could talk about \\"seasons\\" or how this is just cyclical, but I would argue this isn\'t about things going through their natural progression, this is structural. The way the world has been built and rebuilt post-WW2\u2014how the global north exploits and extracts from the global south\u2014most people have no idea what I\'m talking about right now. And that\'s the issue. The very structure and mechanisms by which our society operates and runs today isn\'t \\"flawed\\"\u2014it\'s designed to deliver exactly what we see. It reminds me of W. Edwards Deming\'s famous quote*\\"Every system is perfectly designed to get the result that it does.\\"*\\n\\nWe could talk about neoliberalism, white supremacy, fascism, and far-right ideology\u2014and we\'d essentially be talking about the same thing. Most of this is outside the scope of this essay, but I wanted to put those keywords in the frame so you start to think about how deep these things go- what you see and hear every day, to what has been built and forged in local and international systems for millennia.\\n\\nNow, do you think individual optimism and adaptability is going to get the job done of systemic change (the thing that\'s needed)? Straight up, all of that shit is gaslighting. I know this shit\'s heavy. To even think about it, for a lot of us, is to remind ourselves how overwhelming and futile it feels to go against the grain. I\'m right there with you, but that doesn\'t make these things any less true. And even that right there, that feeling (that it\'s futile)... is also gaslighting.\\n\\nWhy? Because people are powerful.\\n\\nPeople working together, with other people, looking out for each other and being there for each other- is the most powerful thing in the world. Bar none. Powerful institutions and people in positions of power know this- which is why they must divide, disarm, and disempower people. Reminds me of the story of the Tower of Babel. I\'m paraphrasing here, but a whole bunch of people got together, co-ordinated and collaborated and built a tower that stretched into the sky, almost reaching the heavens and God panicked and cast a spell on all the people where they all spoke different languages so couldn\'t understand each other. And thus, thwarted the Tower of Babel. See the theme there? A God, had to divide the people in order not to be overthrown (again, paraphrasing and oversimplifying).\\n\\n> What\'s the link to this AI, and Tech?\\n\\nOther than the obvious\u2014AI\'s many issues with extraction, intellectual property and copyright violations, bias, toxicity and harms to Indigenous communities, climate and water usage\u2014other than***those***... of the many things to choose from, one quote from an ex-meta engineer hit home for me, in terms of this power, people, and the distracting or diversion tactic:\\n\\n\u275d\\"The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads. That sucks.\\"\\n\\n\u2014 Jeff Hammerbacher (ex-Meta engineer)I get it. These private sector, for-profit jobs pay the best. They tend to have the better resources, perks, compensation\u2014all-round things that make this life*better*. So of course they\'re going to get the lion\'s share of people, usually the most brilliant people at that.\\n\\nSo the most powerful companies, get the most talented people, using human societies best skills... to make people click ads.\\n\\nThat\'s the link.\\n\\nSo. What do we do with all this? Fuck knows- is my initial response. Not because I don\'t know, or don\'t have ideas or feelings about it. But honestly, I\'m a little bit tired of thinking about it all the time. Sure, we\'re not all the same in how we approach, implement or philosophise life, so this is just a little insight in how I operate and how I see and analyse the world. It\'s how I\'ve done it for as long as I can remember. Since intermediate, high school and every year after. Before I knew anything about anything, I knew something was off\u2014at least from my vantage point. So everything I\'ve learned since\u2014via formal education, self-study, or lived experience\u2014it\'s just tiring seeing the matrix this long and while the crumbs of improvement have been flicked off the table towards us to appease us, the exploitation and extraction machine soldiers on, gaining power, racking up the body count.\\n\\nBleak. Hahahaha. Yes, bleak.\\n\\nBut at least if we start there\u2014not out of despair, but out of being tired of the facade and wanting to do something about it. I\'m in tech, I\'m a technologist, so my call to action isn\'t even that radical (depending on your definition or level of severity to achieve radical status)\u2014it\'s to tech people to start being honest with themselves about their place in this system, because I\'m done with us pretending we\'re not contributing to every calamity or disaster around us. I understand it maybe comes from a place of survival, of minding our business because it doesn\'t affect us and we\'re \\"lucky\\" to be shielded from it. I totally get that. But let\'s not bullshit ourselves and others that we don\'t know the impact of what we\'re a part of. I think I respect a position of knowing we\'re the stormtroopers of the Death Star, rather than convincing ourselves we have anything to do with the resistance because we helped an underrepresented group play with some big tech technology a couple of times a year.\\n\\n2026 is going to be the year of not doing the corporate talking points anymore. It\'s about finding the people and causes that can build alternative power structures. We stop living in the corporate tech bro shared fantasy that we\'re helping make the world a better place, when really we\'re hiding away in our gated communities flying the \\"we are in this together\\" flags from the safety of our lived realities\u2014realities that let us change the channel or switch the outside world off altogether when things get too uncomfortable.\\n\\nIn a reality where multiple things can be true at once- yes, things can be shit, we can 100% be complicit in the bullshit happening in the world, but I also genuinely wish you a happy holiday break and hope you and your families get the rest and recharge needed to head into the new year- because you\'re going to need it.\\n\\n2026 actions speak louder than words.\\n\\nThanks for reading. I\'ll be taking a break in January\u2014back in February with our regularly scheduled programming of Uncommon Engineer optimism and wisdom.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"ai-is-a-conversation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/ai-is-a-conversation","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2025-12-07 - AI-Is-a-Conversation.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-07 - AI-Is-a-Conversation.md","title":"AI Is a Conversation","description":"Argues quality AI results depend on user communication skills exposing broader problem with collaborative thinking and perspective-taking.

It was early 2024, and I was delivering a workshop on GenAI. I was talking with one of the company tech leaders, and I was a little surprised at how they were thinking about AI\u2014essentially, off-loading a good chunk of the problem decisions to the LLMs, and little to no emphasis on context details and scope going either way: to, from and back to the LLM.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nWe now know that \\"context\\" is king, apparent in the current surge of \\"context engineering\\" posts and videos\u2014but it did baffle me a bit why this wasn\'t more understood in the early days.\\n\\nBut since that time of my first customer facing engagements, to now, I\'ve had quite a few conversations, and my surprise in that initial engagement led me to poke at this apparent \\"gap\\" in AI understanding\u2014and not in understanding \\"what does an LLM do\\" or \\"how an LLM works\\"\u2014but in what you, the user, thinks is going on between you and the AI system you\'re interacting with.\\n\\n**It\'s always a conversation**\\n\\nThis might sound asinine at this point in the AI hype cycle\u2014but I really don\'t think people fully grasp what this means. It\'s a conversation. And comes with everything a conversation comes with. And I think if this isn\'t fully landing, to me, it calls into question not only what your understanding is of what a conversation is, but also if you\'re any good at having them.\\n\\nSo we should start right at the beginning\u2014a conversation is between one or more people, or entities\u2014I deliberately say \\"one or more\\" because talking to yourself is also a conversation.\\n\\nRight off the bat, you now have multiple \\"points of view\\" to consider\u2014no two people are exactly the same, and with that comes differences in understanding, definitions, experiences, levels of knowledge, levels of awareness and so on.\\n\\nLet\'s call this first level of abstraction, multiple buckets of \\"data\\" or information. It\'s just a static snapshot of information, grouped per entity (person).\\n\\nNow we introduce \\"movement\\"\u2014how I think about the shift from scalar to vector. When the conversation starts moving\u2014entities and their buckets in motion\u2014we have to determine what exactly is driving and steering the conversation. What are the entities\' instructions, motivations and incentives\u2014because this is what will give us an idea of what directions the conversation moves in, what information from the buckets might be used and in what order of priority, and then the resulting trajectory of the conversation.\\n\\nAt this point, you will have an idea of where the conversation is going, why it\'s going that way, and potentially highlight what data might be missing from the conversation to have had it go in a direction you actually wanted it to go.\\n\\n*What\'s an example of this phenomenon?*\\n\\nVibe coding yourself to an over-engineered, over-complicated, useless application that doesn\'t deliver what you wanted it to.\\n\\nAnd why did it go wrong? How do I count the ways:\\n\\n- Jumped straight into \\"build\\" mode with no prior thinking, no discussion, nothing outside a vague idea of what you wanted to achieve\u2014what you want to build, sure, but you don\'t actually know what you want to achieve.\\n\\n- Allowed too much of the design thinking to be done by the LLM. Now you\'re in its world, which vaguely resembles our current understanding of how humans think, but ultimately is orders of magnitude more basic and less capable than the human brain.\\n\\n- The incentives of the LLM are to \\"please its user\\"\u2014what kind of goal is that? Do you know where that\'s going to take things, left unchecked?\\n\\nI\'ve seen Coursera courses made by big-time CEOs who have learned this concept, coaching executives on making the AI your \\"thought partner\\", and that concept is the collaborative element of AI, that the process is a two-way street that requires listening to understand what\'s coming back to you and adapting to things going back.\\n\\nOther examples include:\\n\\n- Asking ChatGPT for business strategy advice, getting generic platitudes back, then declaring \\"AI is crap for business plans\\"\u2014completely missing that you asked a nothing question and got a nothing answer back.\\n\\n- Copy-pasting increasingly complex prompts and code from the internet, wondering why you\'re getting inconsistent results, never stopping to think: \\"maybe I don\'t actually understand what I\'m funnelling into the AI\u2014how could I possibly know what to expect back?\\"\\n\\nAnd I think the inability to see and understand not just this concept, but inherently, how deeply this is crucial to your interactions with AI, exposes something that was probably either hidden behind other factors in the workplace, or processes that allowed this gap to not be fully appreciated\u2014\\n\\nYou suck at communication.\\n\\nYou don\'t know how to listen to understand, you don\'t know how to self-reflect, to empathise and to consider different points of view. The \\"other\\" in this case is the AI. You used to be able to fob it off on other people, and processes etc, but now it\'s just you and the tools.\\n\\nAI isn\'t exposing a technical skills gap. It\'s exposing people who\'ve never learned to think collaboratively, listen generatively, or hold space for differing perspectives. People who used to get cover through team dynamics where teammates picked up the slack, or managers who\'d bark \\"harden up\\" or \\"find somewhere else to work\\" when they couldn\'t possibly admit to a leadership problem.\\n\\nNow it\'s just you and the stochastic parrot who\'d happily drive you both off a cliff if you asked. You\'ve only got yourself to look at in the mirror and ask: \\"Do I actually know how to communicate well? Or am I a bit shit at it?\\"\\n\\nI approach AI like it\'s doing its best impression of human thinking, and I\'m doing my best impression of a human right alongside it. Whether that makes me better at this than most people, or just aware enough to see how shit we all are at it\u2014I\'ll let you decide.\\n\\nThanks for reading,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"re-host-re-factor-re-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/re-host-re-factor-re-up","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2025-11-23 - Re-Host-Re-Factor-Re-Up.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-23 - Re-Host-Re-Factor-Re-Up.md","title":"Re-Host.

I gave it a simple project idea - a Chrome extension to highlight bias in news articles - but my overly complex project description led to a 96-task implementation plan that completely missed the point. The lesson: Even the input to SDD frameworks matters enormously.\\n\\n## The Experiment Setup\\n\\nI wanted to test Spec-Driven Development, specifically using [spec-kit](https://github.com/specify-ai/spec-kit) integrated with Claude Code. The idea wasn\'t exactly simple: build a Chrome extension that highlights obviously biased language in news articles, but I had faith SDD would be able to handle it.\\n\\nInstead of just building it with a light vibe coding session, I decided to feed this into the spec-kit framework to see what SDD would produce.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n**My input description** (this was my first mistake):\\n> \\"This project is a Chrome extension that analyzes news articles and other web content to detect and reduce bias.

What should have been \\"highlight bias words\\" became a comprehensive news analysis platform description.\\n\\n## What Spec-Kit Generated\\n\\nThe framework took my verbose description and created:\\n\\n- **18 functional requirements** (FR-001 through FR-018)\\n- **6 detailed data models** (ArticleContent, BiasHighlight, FactualClaim, etc.)\\n- **8 API endpoints** for different analysis functions\\n- **96 numbered tasks** organized into phases\\n- **Performance targets** (&lt;2s analysis, &lt;500ms highlighting)\\n- **Multiple processing modes** (local AI, cloud APIs)\\n\\nLooking at this output, any reasonable person would think this was a serious enterprise project- which would be fine if I was building a real product, but I was just trying to test SDD.\\n\\n## The Implementation Reality Check\\n\\nAfter half a day of following the generated spec with extensive \\"vibe-coding\\" (rapid, intuitive development), here\'s what I actually built:\\n\\n**What Works:**\\n\\n- \u2705 Extracts text from web pages\\n- \u2705 Finds basic patterns like \\"73%\\" and \\"$2.3 billion\\"\\n- \u2705 Has a storage system\\n\\n**What Doesn\'t Work:**\\n\\n- \u274c Buggy, basic bias detection\\n- \u274c No fact-checking\\n\\n**The harsh truth**: I have a basic app that finds percentages in text, not a Chrome extension that detects bias.\\n\\n## The Complexity Wall in Action\\n\\nThe most telling moment came during testing. I spent hours building increasingly specific regex patterns to satisfy test cases:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Started simple\\npattern: /\\\\d+%/gi\\n\\n// Became this monstrosity to pass tests\\npattern: /\\\\b(current|currently|as of (today|now|\\\\d{4})|current(ly)?)\\\\s+[^.!?]*\\\\b/gi\\n\\n// And eventually this madness\\n{\\n  type: ClaimType.STATISTICAL,\\n  pattern: /Water boils at \\\\d+\xb0C/gi,\\n  priority: ClaimPriority.HIGH,\\n  description: \'Temperature boiling point statements\',\\n  examples: [\'Water boils at 100\xb0C\']\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI was adding patterns like \\"Water boils at 100\xb0C\\" to pass tests instead of asking: **\\"Would a real user care about detecting this?\\"**\\n\\n## The Specific Failure Points\\n\\n### 1. **Test-Driven Anti-Pattern**\\n\\nInstead of writing tests for user value, I wrote tests for specification compliance:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Spec-driven test\\nexpect(claimsResponse.claims.length).toBeGreaterThan(3);\\nexpect(temporalClaims.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);\\nexpect(percentageClaims.length).toBeGreaterThan(2);\\n\\n// User-driven test would be\\nexpect(userCanIdentifyObviousBias).toBe(true);\\n```\\n\\n### 2. **Premature Abstraction**\\n\\nThe spec called for 6 services:\\n\\n- ContentExtractor\\n- BiasDetector\\n- ClaimExtractor\\n- ClaimVerifier\\n- ObjectiveRewriter\\n- StorageManager\\n\\nA working prototype needed exactly 1: \\"HighlightObviousBiasWords\\"\\n\\n### 3. **Feature Explosion**\\n\\nThe original idea: \\"Highlight biased language\\"\\n\\nThe spec expanded to:\\n\\n- Fact-checking against external databases\\n- AI-powered claim verification with confidence scores\\n- Objective article rewriting\\n- Both local and cloud AI processing\\n- Performance optimization and caching\\n- Chrome extension manifest configuration\\n\\n### 4. **Zero User Validation**\\n\\n96 tasks to implement features that no user ever requested. The spec assumed people wanted:\\n\\n- Detailed confidence scores\\n- Citation management\\n- Bias radar visualizations\\n- Multiple AI processing modes\\n\\nMaybe users just want obvious bias words highlighted in yellow. We\'ll never know because we never shipped anything testable.\\n\\n## The Simplification Moment\\n\\nThe breakthrough came when I aggressively simplified the claim extractor from 50+ complex patterns to just 4:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Before: 50+ patterns for every edge case\\nprivate readonly patterns: ClaimPattern[] = [\\n  // 47 more patterns...\\n];\\n\\n// After: 4 simple patterns that actually work\\nprivate readonly patterns: ClaimPattern[] = [\\n  {\\n    type: ClaimType.STATISTICAL,\\n    pattern: /\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?%/gi,\\n    description: \'Percentage values\'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    type: ClaimType.STATISTICAL,\\n    pattern: /\\\\$\\\\d+(\\\\.\\\\d+)?\\\\s*(million|billion)/gi,\\n    description: \'Currency amounts\'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    type: ClaimType.TEMPORAL,\\n    pattern: /\\\\b(January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December)\\\\s+\\\\d{4}\\\\b/gi,\\n    description: \'Month and year references\'\\n  },\\n  {\\n    type: ClaimType.TEMPORAL,\\n    pattern: /\\\\b202\\\\d\\\\b/gi,\\n    description: \'Recent years\'\\n  }\\n];\\n```\\n\\nImmediately, 6 out of 8 tests passed. The complex patterns were solving imaginary problems.\\n\\n## What I Should Have Done\\n\\n**Week 1: Stupid Simple Prototype**\\n\\n```javascript\\n// 20 lines of code\\nconst biasWords = [\'devastating\', \'shocking\', \'outrageous\', \'slam\'];\\nconst textNodes = document.querySelectorAll(\'p\');\\ntextNodes.forEach(node => {\\n  biasWords.forEach(word => {\\n    if (node.textContent.includes(word)) {\\n      node.innerHTML = node.innerHTML.replace(\\n        new RegExp(word, \'gi\'),\\n        `<mark style=\\"background: yellow\\">${word}</mark>`\\n      );\\n    }\\n  });\\n});\\n```\\n\\nShip this. See if anyone uses it. Get feedback.\\n\\n**Week 2-4: Iterate Based on Feedback**\\nOnly add complexity that users actually request.\\n\\n## The Lessons\\n\\n### 1. **Specifications Are Procrastination**\\n\\nWriting detailed specs feels productive but delays the only thing that matters: user feedback.\\n\\n### 2. **Complexity Walls Are Real**\\n\\nThere\'s a point where additional features make it harder, not easier, to ship something useful.\\n\\n### 3. **Test What Users Care About**\\n\\nTesting specification compliance is not the same as testing user value.\\n\\n### 4. **Start Embarrassingly Simple**\\n\\nA working prototype that highlights 10 bias words is infinitely more valuable than a sophisticated system that analyzes confidence scores of extracted temporal claims.\\n\\n### 5. **Frameworks Encourage Over-Engineering**\\n\\nThe \\"proper\\" way to build software often prevents you from building software at all.\\n\\n## The Real Cost\\n\\nTime spent: **1 weeks**\\nLines of code written: **~3,000**\\nChrome extensions shipped: **0**\\nUser feedback collected: **0**\\nProblems solved: **0**\\n\\nA 20-line bias word highlighter would have solved an actual problem and been in users\' hands on day 1.\\n\\n## What\'s Next\\n\\nI\'ve already scrapped this down to MVP level and rebuliding from scratch, and got a working prototype ready to publish and get user feedback.\\n\\nIf people use it, iterate. If they don\'t, I\'ll know in days instead of months.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nDetailed specifications create an illusion of progress while preventing actual progress. The road to user value is paved with working prototypes, not comprehensive requirements documents.\\n\\n---\\n\\n:::info \ud83e\udd16 AI Collaboration\\nThis post was generated from a real debugging session with my AI assistant.

And that\u2019s definitely not for a lack of thoughts or things to say LOL. It\u2019s just been a bit of a weird (and wonderful) time for me personally, professionally, spiritually etc.\\n\\nSometimes I\u2019ll write through it, and I think it shows in my writing, but this time I chose to just stop- have a think about the world, look around and see if I could still see everything around me, not just the thing I\u2019m currently hyper-focused on, cos often when that\u2019s the case, everything else around me is blurry.\\n\\nI never thought that was an issue before, I\u2019m usually hyper focused digging into some new tech, or social issue, and I like going deep. But when that\u2019s applied to anything and everything, the world starts getting really out of balance for me.\\n\\nSo, just stopping- having a look around, and if I\u2019m not feeling it, I\u2019ll just try to do something else like go to the gym, or watch a show and try to turn my brain off.\\n\\nThen I remembered a lot of what helped turn my brain off, or at least settle it down, was writing\u2026\\n\\nSo there\u2019s been this weird loop of \u201cI\u2019m too hyper-focused, so I shouldn\u2019t write anything, I\u2019ll do something else to settle it down, that turns out to be very temporary, now I\u2019m too hyper-focused, so I shouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\\n\\nThat\u2019s the weird[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\nThe wonderful is (and I will do a proper post and share of it at some stage) getting myPe\u2019a.

You get a bored Ape image, that you exchange real money for, to be given an address in cyberspace, with a \\"claim\\" to that Ape.\\n\\nSeriously.\\n\\nSeriously, are you reading that sentence the way I am, while writing it?\\n\\nIt\'s in-sane!\\n\\nThe value of these things were all in the perception of it, like stocks and futures trading- pure speculation. It was something off into the future that you bet money would still be valuable when you got to that future[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\nNFT\'s were not tied to anything of value in the real world. Unless, of course, you count your hopes and dreams of a libertarian society as the real world assets this scam was connected to. And like pyramid schemes, aka multi-level marketing programmes, this scam needed***people***- droves of people to participate in the grift in order to see \\"value\\" in the system.\\n\\nThis mainly came in the form of the masses\' money being funnelled to the \\"early adopters\\" via rug pull.\\n\\n## The Evidence Debate\\n\\nTo make this claim about AI feels somewhat disingenuous to me.\\n\\nEspecially now, when we\'re 2 years post ChatGPT release, with all the flurry of research, development activity, progress and market signalling.\\n\\nI\'ve seen those against AI hold up research to show AI doesn\'t do a thing well, or make a mistake a human wouldn\'t, or hasn\'t and will never deliver AGI.\\n\\nSure, I get that.\\n\\nBut you can also find research that shows the opposite.\\n\\nThat AI is helping, and improving outcomes- even if it\'s not where the marketers and the AI grifters have lead us to believe the benefits are coming from.\\n\\nEvidence-based thinking is a tricky aspect of today\'s world.\\n\\nWe\'ve lost trust in established institutions founded on science and evidence ~ and rightly so for various organisations for various reasons. We are living in a white supremacist world after all. Do we really think all these incumbent legacy institutions were established with the good of all humanity in mind?\\n\\nLet\'s not be naive.\\n\\nSome deserved to lose their trusted status. Some deserved to no longer be held up as sources of truth.\\n\\nSo, I get that.\\n\\nBut that doesn\'t mean evidence, scientific methods, research and the pursuit of knowledge, meaning and truth, don\'t exist anymore- they are more valuable than ever given the day and age we live in.\\n\\nOn one hand, the research that says \u2018AI is a hallucinating, confidently incorrect stochastic parrot\u2019.\\n\\nTrue, but with nuance.\\n\\nWe don\'t take it all at face value, despite what major research names may be on the papers. The same way we don\'t believe everything OpenAI says about\u2026 well, about anything really. We listen, we read, we do our best to verify the claims. And if you\'re doing that to both sides of the argument, I would challenge the view that AI adds*no*value to anyone using it.\\n\\n## The Value Question\\n\\nTo say AI has \\"no value\\" is, to me, to devalue the experiences of those who have managed to utilise the capability the technology has been able to provide.\\n\\nBut AI\u2026 yeah, AI burns mad resources, AI does not do everything the grifters and the marketers promise.\\n\\nAI is not a***lot***of things, but to say it\'s \\"nothing\\"?\\n\\nI can\u2019t take the position seriously.\\n\\nI\u2019m not making a moral judgement on the absolute value of AI, taking into consideration all things that are important to everyone. No.\\n\\nI\u2019m just asking, was this technology able to help you in a way that you weren\u2019t able to be helped, before?\\n\\nMaking the judgement whether something is adding*value*somewhere is to understand something\'s struggle, aspirations, fears and needs. Saying AI is adding nothing to all peoples everywhere, is in my opinion, hubris on a massive scale.\\n\\nIf it adds no value to***you***, okay, but to dictate to everyone what value it holds to them, is a dangerous precedent that quickly moves to ignorance and then stubbornness.\\n\\n## Real-World Benefits\\n\\nHas AI helped you in any way?\\n\\nI was told that whatever help I got from AI, was only perceived, was not real, that it was all wrong and a hallucination.\\n\\nDid it help you understand a concept you weren\'t quite sure how to articulate, but was able to converse your way to an understanding with a chatbot?\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nDid it help you build a small app or website? Did it make the experience easier than finding and reading the right tutorial for you? Was it more interactive than watching a video of someone else\'s setup getting it to work?\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nWere you able to have conversations with a likeness trained on texts and studies? Studies that you might never have the opportunity to read otherwise? Did you glean some insight or knowledge from that conversation, in your own time and space?\\n\\nOk.\\n\\nI can\u2019t speak for anyone else\u2019s experience, I can only speak from mine.\\n\\nI am someone who uses AI on a daily basis for text, code, images and it has scaled my capacity and capability massively. There is no way I would be able to do the things I\'m doing now, without it.\\n\\nDo I need to check my work?\\n\\nOf course.\\n\\nAm I sure this code is bullet proof?\\n\\nOf course not, but I know how to check, and I know enough to ensure and care about making bulletproof code.\\n\\nBut I\u2019m not going to sit here and act like I haven\u2019t worked with human beings over the last 20 years in tech who haven\u2019t made some horrendous errors in coding, security and operations.\\n\\nWhat about text summaries? Same deal, how do I know any human knows everything about everything and is always right? I don\'t, but how do I get the best out of any expert? I talk, I push, I query, I challenge.\\n\\nThe*conversation*is what\'s of value to me, this is not zero-shot copy and paste.\\n\\nIf you were this person before\u2014not checking your work after reading things online and submitting it without filtering it through your own brain\u2014then this is no different.\\n\\nIt just makes it faster for you to produce more slop that looks like everyone else\u2019 slop.\\n\\n## There Are Definitely Problems, in AI\\n\\nYes, there are problems.\\n\\nNo-one (well, I\'m not) is denying there are issues with the current AI marketplace.\\n\\nIt\'s full of grift, sustainability issues, bias and toxicity, labour displacement, intellectual property theft, labour displacement, etc.\\n\\nThese are rightfully concerning, and will have a massive effect on society. This is especially true given how quickly the technology is being adopted. Much of this adoption is driven by sales and marketing hype, fear-based arguments for regulatory control, or simple fear of missing out.\\n\\nThere\u2019s folks, even in the Pasifika circles, promoting masterclasses in AI, with no AI background or professional experience- how are we to take these things seriously?\\n\\nYes, Sam Altman talks a bunch of shit- \\"AGI this\\" and \\"AGI that\\" since ChatGPT launched, and we\'re still on GPT4. I\'m not saying developing AI models is easy by any stretch of the imagination, but good lord in heaven STFU with the marketing hype!\\n\\nBut what I am surprised by is that those same folks are reporting that enterprises are finding it difficult to get real ROI from their AI investments. They\'ve commented on the dissatisfaction between what they were told AI could do and what it\'s actually capable of doing for their business.\\n\\nNo shit, Sherlock- did you hype-market spectators think for a second that this wasn\'t going to turn out badly? When hype meets reality, did you think there was going to be a happy customer at the end of that story?!\\n\\n## Moving Forward\\n\\nSo yes, there\'s bullshit-galore in the market. There are AI solutions that are not ready for prime-time being rolled out in education and law enforcement. And people are definitely going to have a bad time.\\n\\nYou can have your value-based views on anything you want. But we don\'t manoeuvre this world alone - as much as we want or try to. We exist within systems and ecosystems of interconnected people, resources and realities.\\n\\nBut abstaining from the tech, in my view, is not the move.\\n\\nUnless, of course, you have the majority of the workforce worldwide signed up to join you en-masse? Because if you have that, I\'m down for it.\\n\\nThat would actually do something.\\n\\nMy take? The faction that is able to wield this technology, for gain or for survival, gets to hang around. History has shown the folks who abstain from the technology of the time don\'t usually make it out of that era.\\n\\nIs that really what you\'re choosing?\\n\\nThanks for reading,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"to-live-die-in-simulation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/to-live-die-in-simulation","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2025-03-11 - To-Live-and-Die-in-the-Simulation.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-11 - To-Live-and-Die-in-the-Simulation.md","title":"To Live and Die in the Simulation","description":"Examines living in simulated normalcy while real world suffers documenting contradiction between everyday routine and global catastrophe.

Cost of living crisis, unemployment and homelessness increasing, businesses closing, the economy in a shambles and a NZ government ruthlessly and relentlessly slashing public services readying them for privatisation.\\n\\nAll the while, vilifying the victims of a legacy and history of malice and misfortune, ethnic and other minorities.\\n\\nThe usual targets.\\n\\nThere\'s just layers, and layers of this shit from international, to regional, Pacific, Australia and finally local here in New Zealand.\\n\\nYou\'d be forgiven for thinking this rant was another one of my*\\"the world sucks, everything\'s burning but f**k it, let it burn, it all deserves to go to hell anyway\\"*rants.\\n\\nAnd you\'d be mostly right - that\'s sort of my default initial setting when faced with these facts.\\n\\n# The Catharsis in Writing\\n\\nBut this, out of the blue newsletter, which I\'m sure folks are wondering which thing they signed up for now, is another semi-update of where life is right now for me, and finding that using this writing outlet to just - dump thoughts, edit and publish - is very\u2026\\n\\n*cathartic*.\\n\\n*Is that what the Uncommon Engineer newsletter has become?*\\n\\nWell, sort of, yeah.\\n\\nWhen I wanted to separate out the more \\"technical\\" things, into deep dives and commentary on things happening in the industry, the LinkedIn page made sense. It was essentially a way to \\"showcase\\" that information there[2](#footnote-2). The newsletter, on the other hand, was going to be the social commentary. I have about 30 drafts on different topics. They range from the scourge of middle management to being pigeon-holed by multiple dimensions all in the same, single user entity.\\n\\n## What Makes You Tick?\\n\\nBut then I re-discovered things that made me happier than writing down my weird and wacky takes, like building and making tech things.\\n\\nSome for profit, most for just scratching the itch of just fucking around with a technology or platform or device to see what it can and can\'t do.\\n\\nThis doesn\'t need an audience - it has one already.\\n\\nMe.\\n\\n## The Dilemma.\\n\\nAnd therein lies my dilemma, to choose between a thing that I love and that might not make me a living wage, and a thing that I\'m good at that\'s paying everything off and more.\\n\\n\u201cDo both\u201d, I hear people say.\\n\\nI have.\\n\\nFor years, I\'ve done things alongside my tech career - professional drummer, cage fighter, community charity founder, motorcycle group \\"patched\\" member[3](#footnote-3), Brazilian Jujitsu black belt, and more.\\n\\nI know people have hobbies and their main job, but as you can see my hobbies aren\'t part-time commitment level things. They usually need full-time commitment time investments. That\'s how you burn evenings, early hours, and weekends, for years. All to live this \\"do both\\" philosophy.\\n\\n## New Purpose?\\n\\nWhere was I?\\n\\nOh yeah, this newsletter.\\n\\nI first started it to see if I could make it a \\"thing\\". I knew it would be hard, I\'ve done these things before, the goal was to make it something that I could lean on in the future, brand recognition or finances-wise. It would earn money eventually, or open opportunities.\\n\\nBut as much as I\'m a writer, or enjoy writing[4](#footnote-4), I\'m hard to narrow things down to a single-focus. Even though I know, and already experienced that I do my best work when I\'m single-focused.\\n\\nSometimes the stars will align[5](#footnote-5), I\'ll focus, and I get some great outcomes. My life has been a series of alignment challenges, level unpredictable.\\n\\n## The Way Forward\\n\\nI\'m working on some things now, and for better or worse, I may have to shut down some things that I was keen on before - I was thinking this newsletter, but then\u2026 what if I just keep writing stuff?\\n\\nNow - I read a lot of other writers\' stuff, journalists and folks who not only do writing for a living, but it\'s really their thing.\\n\\nSo I know that\'s not what\'s on offer here with my writing lol.\\n\\nAnd maybe the pressure to either be all things to everyone, or even be something to someone, anyone, is alleviated when I can just write when I find the space, or conviction to make a thought and writing.\\n\\n## The Beginning Is the End, Is The\u2026\\n\\nThat\'s the madness that surrounds my inner world, juxtaposed against the madness of the outside world, and you and I carry on, brushing our teeth and taking the rubbish out on Weds, like everything\'s normal.\\n\\nLike sure \\"things can be a bit shit, but that\'s life, right?\\" type normal, but it really isn\'t.\\n\\nIt\'s a simulation.\\n\\nthanks for reading,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"/2025/03/04/agentic-ai-part-4","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/03/04/agentic-ai-part-4","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2025-03-04-agentic-ai-part-4.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-04-agentic-ai-part-4.md","title":"Part 4: The Anatomy of AI Agents - Practical Security Implications","description":"Explore practical security implications of AI agent vulnerabilities and learn about defense strategies, security principles, and approaches for protecting against agent-related threats in enterprise environments.","date":"2025-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"agentic-ai","permalink":"/blog/tags/agentic-ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"security","permalink":"/blog/tags/security"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai-defense","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai-defense"},{"inline":true,"label":"security-principles","permalink":"/blog/tags/security-principles"},{"inline":true,"label":"cybersecurity-strategy","permalink":"/blog/tags/cybersecurity-strategy"},{"inline":true,"label":"ai-security-framework","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai-security-framework"},{"inline":true,"label":"enterprise-ai-security","permalink":"/blog/tags/enterprise-ai-security"}],"readingTime":6.86,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ron Amosa","title":"Hacker/Engineer/Geek","url":"/about/","imageURL":"/img/profile.svg","key":"ron","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Part 4: The Anatomy of AI Agents - Practical Security Implications","date":"2025-03-04T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["ron"],"tags":["agentic-ai","security","ai-defense","security-principles","cybersecurity-strategy","ai-security-framework","enterprise-ai-security"],"image":"/img/blog/agentic-ai-part4-cover.png","description":"Explore practical security implications of AI agent vulnerabilities and learn about defense strategies, security principles, and approaches for protecting against agent-related threats in enterprise environments."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"To Live and Die in the Simulation","permalink":"/blog/to-live-die-in-simulation"},"nextItem":{"title":"Part 3: AI Agent Security Vulnerabilities - Brain and Perception Module Analysis","permalink":"/blog/2025/02/25/agentic-ai-part-3"}},"content":"![Practical AI Agent Security Implications and Defense Strategies](/img/blog/agentic-ai-part4-cover.png)\\n\\nIn [Part 3](/blog/2025/02/25/agentic-ai-part-3), we explored the core components of AI agents\u2014the Brain, Perception, and Action modules\u2014and the specific security vulnerabilities each introduces. Now, let\'s examine how these vulnerabilities create practical security challenges and discuss approaches for mitigating these risks.\\n\\n## Practical Security Implications\\n\\nUnderstanding individual component vulnerabilities is important, but the real security challenge emerges when we consider how these vulnerabilities interact in practice.\\n\\nThe interconnected nature of AI agent components creates a security challenge greater than the sum of its parts. Vulnerabilities in one component can cascade through the system, creating complex attack scenarios that traditional security approaches may struggle to address.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nConsider these real-world scenarios that illustrate the cascading nature of AI agent vulnerabilities:\\n\\n1. **The Perception-Brain-Action Attack Chain**:\\n    - An attacker injects adversarial content into an image processed by the Perception module.\\n    - This causes the Brain to misinterpret the context and make an incorrect decision.\\n    - The Action module then executes this flawed decision, potentially affecting critical systems.\\n\\n![Perception-Brain-Action Attack Chain](/img/blog/perception-brain-action-attack-chain.png)\\n2. **The Memory Poisoning Persistence**:\\n    - An attacker uses prompt injection to insert malicious content into the agent\'s memory.\\n    - This poisoned memory persists across sessions and influences future decisions.\\n    - Even after the initial attack vector is addressed, the agent continues to make compromised decisions.\\n\\n![Memory Poisoning Persistence Attack](/img/blog/memory-poisoning-persistence-attack.png)\\n3. **The Tool Escalation Scenario**:\\n    - An attacker manipulates the agent into using an authorised tool in an unintended way.\\n    - This creates access to additional capabilities beyond the original security boundaries.\\n    - These new capabilities are then used to execute actions that bypass existing security controls.\\n\\n![Tool Chain Escalation Scenario](/img/blog/tool-chain-escalation-scenario.png)\\n\\nThe evolving threat landscape presents additional challenges as AI agents gain new capabilities:\\n\\n- **Dynamic Tool Creation**: As agents develop the ability to create their own tools, security teams must address the challenge of evaluating tools that didn\'t exist during initial security assessments.\\n- **Multi-agent Interactions**: When multiple agents work together, security vulnerabilities can propagate across the system, potentially creating new attack vectors that wouldn\'t exist with isolated agents.\\n- **Emergent Behaviours**: Advanced agents may develop emergent behaviours not anticipated by their designers, creating security implications that are difficult to predict and mitigate in advance.\\n\\nThese practical implications highlight the need for security approaches specifically designed for the unique challenges presented by AI agents, moving beyond traditional application security paradigms.\\n\\n## Security Principles for AI Agents\\n\\nWhile AI agents present novel security challenges, many traditional security principles can be adapted and applied to this new context. Here\'s how to apply security fundamentals to the unique architecture of AI agents:\\n\\n### Defense-in-Depth for AI Systems\\n\\n1. **Component-Specific Mitigations**:\\n\\n    - **Brain (LLM) Protections**:\\n        - Implement robust prompt validation and sanitization.\\n        - Develop hierarchical instruction processing with clear priority frameworks.\\n        - Create memory integrity verification mechanisms.\\n        - Regularly audit and clear sensitive information from agent memory.\\n    - **Perception Module Safeguards**:\\n        - Deploy multi-modal input validation across all supported formats.\\n        - Implement anomaly detection for unusual input patterns.\\n        - Create redundant perception pathways for critical inputs.\\n        - Regular testing with adversarial examples to improve robustness.\\n    - **Action Module Controls**:\\n        - Implement principle of least privilege for tool access.\\n        - Create tool and API usage policies specific to agent capabilities.\\n        - Deploy runtime monitoring for unusual or potentially harmful actions.\\n        - Develop rollback mechanisms for all agent-initiated changes.\\n2. **System-Wide Security Measures**:\\n    - **Containment Strategies**: Sandbox environments where agents can be tested before deployment.\\n    - **Monitoring Frameworks**: Specialised logging and monitoring designed for AI agent activities.\\n    - **Incident Response Plans**: Procedures specifically designed for AI agent compromise scenarios.\\n    - **Regular Security Assessments**: Continuous testing with specialised focus on AI-specific vulnerabilities.\\n\\n![Defense-in-Depth for AI Systems](/img/blog/defense-in-depth-ai-systems.png)\\n\\n\\n### Applying Zero Trust Principles to AI Agents\\n\\nTaking a page out of what\'s recommended in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, applying zero trust architecture to AI systems provides a strong foundation for agent security:\\n\\n- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Treat the agent\'s components as potentially compromised and verify all transfers between components.\\n- **Least Privilege Access**: Limit each agent\'s access to only the tools and data necessary for its specific function.\\n- **Continuous Authentication**: Regularly validate that the agent is operating as expected through behavioral analysis.\\n- **Micro-segmentation**: Create boundaries between different agent functions and the systems they interact with.\\n\\n### Developing AI-Specific Security Controls\\n\\n- **Prompt Engineering Security**: Creating prompts with security in mind, including built-in guardrails and instruction validation.\\n- **Alignment Techniques**: Using techniques like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) to improve agent security posture.\\n- **Agent Supervision Models**: Creating overseer agents specifically designed to monitor and validate the actions of operational agents.\\n- **Security-Focused Fine-tuning**: Additional training specifically designed to reduce vulnerability to known attack vectors.\\n\\n![OWASP AI Threats and Controls](/img/blog/owasp-ai-threats-controls.png)\\n\\n\\nThe application of these security principles requires a collaborative approach between AI development teams and security professionals, with security considerations integrated throughout the agent development lifecycle rather than applied as an afterthought.\\n\\n## Conclusion: Securing the Future of AI Agents\\n\\nAs we conclude our exploration of agentic AI security, it\'s clear that these systems require both adaptation of traditional security principles and development of entirely new approaches. The interconnected nature of AI agent components creates complex security challenges that will continue to evolve as agent capabilities advance.\\n\\n### Key Takeaways from This Series:\\n\\n1. **[Part 1](/blog/2025/02/12/agentic-ai-part-1)**: AI agents represent autonomous systems with unique security implications\\n2. **[Part 2](/blog/2025/02/18/agentic-ai-part-2)**: Three evolutionary shifts have fundamentally altered the AI security landscape\\n3. **[Part 3](/blog/2025/02/25/agentic-ai-part-3)**: Each agent component introduces specific vulnerabilities that can cascade through systems\\n4. **Part 4** (this post): Practical defense strategies require both traditional principles and AI-specific controls\\n\\n### Moving Forward\\n\\nFor security professionals facing the immediate challenge of securing AI agents in their environments, the most important first step is developing a comprehensive understanding of how these systems function and the specific vulnerabilities they introduce. This understanding forms the foundation for effective security strategies.\\n\\nThe security landscape will continue evolving as AI agents become more sophisticated. Staying informed about emerging threats, maintaining strong fundamentals, and adapting security practices will be essential for protecting against both current and future risks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Continue the Discussion\\n\\nThis concludes our four-part exploration of agentic AI security.

As organizations rapidly adopt these powerful systems, understanding these vulnerabilities becomes essential for security professionals tasked with protecting their environments.\\n\\nAt its core, an AI agent consists of three primary components: the Brain (typically an LLM) that handles reasoning and decision-making, the Perception module that processes environmental inputs, and the Action module that interacts with systems and tools. Each component introduces unique security challenges that, when combined, create a complex attack surface unlike anything we\'ve seen in traditional systems.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Anatomy of an AI Agent\\n\\nBefore diving into specific vulnerabilities, let\'s get a clear understanding of how modern AI agents operate. Unlike traditional software systems with well-defined input/output relationships, AI agents function much more dynamically and have complex internal processes.\\n\\nThe Brain (LLM) serves as the central nervous system, processing information and making decisions based on its training and current context. The Perception module acts as the agent\'s senses, interpreting raw data from various sources and converting it to meaningful information the Brain can process. The Action module then functions as the agent\'s hands, executing commands and interacting with external systems based on the Brain\'s decisions.\\n\\nThis architecture creates powerful capabilities but also introduces significant security challenges at each layer. What makes these systems particularly concerning from a security perspective is that a vulnerability in one component can cascade through the entire system, potentially affecting multiple downstream systems and data sources connected to the agent.\\n\\n![AI Agent Components](/img/blog/ai-agent-components.png)\\n\\nLet\'s look at each component\'s specific security implications in detail.\\n\\n## Component 1: The Brain (LLM Core)\\n\\nThe Brain component, as the central nervous system in our agent anatomy, deserves special attention from a security perspective precisely because of its sophistication and complexity. The vulnerabilities here are particularly concerning because they target the very core of what makes these systems powerful i.e. their ability to reason and make decisions.\\n\\nLooking under the hood, we can categorise these vulnerabilities into two main tracks. Many of these align with critical categories in the OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model Applications, particularly \\"LLM Prompt Injection\\" and \\"Insecure Output Handling\\":\\n\\n### Decision Pipeline Vulnerabilities\\n\\n- **Prompt Injection**: At its core, prompt injection exploits a fundamental weakness in how LLMs process instructions - their lack of sophisticated hierarchical processing. Without clear frameworks for prioritizing instructions, attackers can embed malicious commands that override the agent\'s original instructions. The \\"Ignore the document\\" study demonstrated how a simple prefix could bypass contextual safeguards by exploiting the LLM\'s tendency to give more weight to immediate instructions than established boundaries.\\n\\n![Prompt Injection Attack](/img/blog/prompt-injection.png)\\n\\n- **LLM-to-LLM Prompt Infection**: Building on the hierarchical processing weakness, a compromised agent becomes \\"patient zero\\" in an infection chain, spreading malicious prompts to other agents in multi-agent systems. This creates a self-replicating infection that silently propagates throughout the ecosystem. While still largely theoretical, recent research (arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07283) suggests this could become a significant threat vector as multi-agent systems become more common.\\n\\n![LLM to LLM Prompt Infection](/img/blog/prompt-infection-llm.png)\\n\\n- **Hierarchical Instruction Processing Weaknesses**: LLMs often lack nuanced hierarchies for processing instructions, making them vulnerable to adversarial prompts that can override contextual safeguards. This structural weakness means that immediate prompts can take precedence over previously established contextual boundaries, creating a fundamental security vulnerability.\\n\\n### Memory Management Risks\\n\\n- **Memory Manipulation**:\\n    - Attackers can artificially inflate importance scores of specific memories, ensuring malicious prompts are retrieved more frequently.\\n- **Context Limitations**:\\n    - Limited memory capacity causes agents to lose track of crucial information during extended interactions, creating security blind spots.\\n    - Adversaries can perform memory poisoning or context erasure, causing the AI agent to forget essential contextual information. This could involve techniques that overwrite or corrupt the agent\'s stored memory or disrupt its ability to access relevant past interactions.\\n    - A jailbreak attack can leverage a language model agent\'s poor contextual understanding to bypass safety protocols and generate harmful content. If an AI agent cannot properly differentiate between legitimate instructions and malicious injections due to contextual limitations, it can be coerced into performing unintended and potentially harmful actions.\\n- **Data Security Concerns**:\\n    - Sensitive information stored in memory can be exposed, leading to unauthorized data extraction and knowledge base poisoning.\\n    - API usage risks can expose sensitive data to third-party providers, potentially causing data leaks and compliance violations.\\n\\nThe real-world implications are substantial, with each vulnerability potentially cascading into system-wide failures or security breaches with serious consequences.\\n\\n![Memory Manipulation Attack](/img/blog/ai-memoryvuln-memory-manipulation.png)\\n\\n![Context Limitations Vulnerabilities](/img/blog/ai-memoryvuln-context-limitations.png)\\n\\n## Component 2: The Perception Module\\n\\nThe Perception module functions as the agent\'s sensory system, converting raw environmental data into structured information for the Brain to process. This component introduces several unique security challenges that expand the attack surface of AI systems, especially given LLMs evolving capabilities with different modalities like audio, visual and video.\\n\\n### Input Validation Challenges\\n\\n- **Multi-modal Vulnerabilities**: As agents gain the ability to process text, images, audio, and other input types, each modality introduces its own attack vectors:\\n    - _Image-based Attacks_: Adversarial images can be crafted to trick vision models into misidentifying objects or extracting misleading information. Research from Goodfellow et al. demonstrated that \\"imperceptible perturbations\\" (a disturbance) to images can cause state-of-the-art vision models to completely mis-classify images (e.g., mistaking a panda for a gibbon) with high confidence. In an AI agent context, this could lead to harmful decisions based on manipulated visual data.\\n    - _Audio Manipulation_: Voice inputs can be manipulated to include hidden commands or distorted in ways that cause misinterpretation while remaining imperceptible to human listeners. The \\"Dolphin Attack\\" research demonstrated how ultrasonic audio can be used to inject commands into voice assistants that humans cannot hear.\\n    - _Cross-modal Attacks_: Information from one modality can be used to influence the interpretation of another, creating complex attack scenarios that are difficult to detect and mitigate.\\n- **Data Preprocessing Risks**: Before raw data reaches the LLM Brain, it undergoes *preprocessing* that can be exploited:\\n    - _Feature Extraction Manipulation_: Attackers can target the feature extraction process, causing the agent to focus on misleading elements of the input.\\n    - _Normalization Attacks_: By understanding how inputs are normalised, attackers can craft inputs that appear normal to humans but are interpreted abnormally by the agent.\\n    - _Serialization Vulnerabilities_: The conversion of complex multi-modal inputs into formats the LLM can process creates additional attack surfaces where malicious content can be inserted.\\n- **Adversarial Attacks**: Specially crafted inputs designed to fool perception systems:\\n    - _Evasion Attacks_: Inputs designed to avoid detection of harmful content by slightly modifying patterns that would typically trigger safety mechanisms.\\n    - _Data Poisoning_: Gradually introducing biased or misleading training examples that can cause systematic misinterpretation of certain input types.\\n\\n![Input Validation Attacks](/img/blog/perception-module-input-validation.png)\\n\\n\\n### Environment Interaction Risks\\n\\n- **Sensor Manipulation and Spoofing**: In cases where AI agents interact with physical sensors or data feeds:\\n\\n    - _Sensor Spoofing_: Falsifying sensor data to create a distorted perception of the environment.\\n    - _Feed Tampering_: Manipulating data feeds to provide misleading information about the state of systems or environments.\\n    - _Replay Attacks_: Recording and replaying previously valid sensor data to mask current conditions.\\n- **Reality-Perception Gaps**: Misalignments between the real world and the agent\'s perception:\\n\\n    - _Concept Drift_: When the agent\'s understanding of the world becomes outdated compared to reality.\\n    - _Distribution Shift_: When the statistical properties of inputs change over time, causing the agent to misinterpret them.\\n    - _Hallucinations_: When perception systems \\"fill in\\" missing information incorrectly, leading to decisions based on non-existent data.\\n- **Trust Boundaries in Perception Systems**:\\n\\n    - _Source Validation Weaknesses_: Insufficient verification of input sources, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate sources.\\n    - _Integrity Verification Gaps_: Lack of mechanisms to ensure inputs haven\'t been tampered with during transmission.\\n    - _Third-party Perception Dependencies_: Reliance on external perception models with potentially unknown vulnerabilities.\\n\\n![Environment Interaction Attacks](/img/blog/perception-module-environment-interactions.png)\\n\\n\\nThe security implications of perception vulnerabilities are particularly concerning because they occur at the entry point of the agent\'s decision-making process. A compromised perception module can feed manipulated information to an otherwise secure Brain, resulting in the classic \\"garbage in, garbage out\\" problem, but with potentially severe consequences in high-trust or critical systems.\\n\\n## Component 3: The Action Module\\n\\nThe Action module is where the AI agent\'s decisions translate into real-world impact through tool use and system interactions. This component represents the \\"hands\\" of the agent and introduces critical security considerations, particularly as agents gain access to more powerful tools and APIs.\\n\\n### Tool Access Control Issues\\n\\n- **Privilege Escalation Vectors**:\\n    - _Tool Chaining Vulnerabilities_: Agents may combine multiple low-privilege tools in ways that effectively create higher-privilege capabilities, similar to how traditional privilege escalation attacks work.\\n    - _Unintended Tool Functionality_: Tools designed for one purpose may have secondary functions that can be exploited when used in unintended ways.\\n    - _Emergent Permissions_: As agents become more sophisticated, they may discover creative ways to use authorized tools to achieve unauthorized outcomes, particularly when multiple tools are available.\\n- **API Security Considerations**:\\n    - _Key Management Risks_: How API keys and credentials are stored, accessed, and used by the agent creates potential exposure points.\\n    - _Rate Limiting Bypasses_: Agents might unintentionally (or if compromised, intentionally) attempt to bypass API rate limits, creating denial-of-service vulnerabilities.\\n    - _Data Transmission Security_: Ensuring secure transmission of data between the agent and external APIs requires robust encryption and validation.\\n    - _API Scope Expansion_: Over time, APIs tend to gain functionality, potentially giving agents access to capabilities beyond what was initially evaluated for security.\\n- **Monitoring Execution of Agent Actions**:\\n    - _Visibility Challenges_: Traditional security monitoring may struggle to interpret the context and intent behind agent-initiated actions.\\n    - _Attribution Difficulties_: Determining whether an action was the result of a legitimate agent decision or a security compromise can be complex.\\n    - _Audit Trail Requirements_: Special considerations for logging agent decisions and actions in ways that allow for meaningful security review.\\n\\n![Tool Access Control Challenges](/img/blog/tool-access-control.png)\\n\\n### Output Processing Vulnerabilities\\n\\n- **Unvalidated Output Execution**:\\n    - _Injection Vulnerabilities_: Without proper validation, outputs from the Brain could contain malicious instructions that get executed in target systems.\\n    - _Command Interpretation Risks_: Ambiguous outputs may be interpreted differently by receiving systems than intended by the agent.\\n    - _Missing Output Sanitization_: Direct execution of agent outputs without proper filtering can lead to inappropriate or harmful actions.\\n- **Output Context Misalignment**:\\n    - _Environmental Mismatch_: Actions appropriate in one context may be harmful in another when the agent misunderstands its operational environment.\\n    - _Temporal Inconsistency_: Actions may become inappropriate due to timing issues between decision-making and execution.\\n    - _Target System Confusion_: The agent may direct outputs to incorrect systems if authentication and routing mechanisms are inadequate.\\n- **Feedback Loop Vulnerabilities**:\\n    - _False Success Signals_: When output execution status is misreported, agents may continue harmful action patterns.\\n    - _Error Handling Weaknesses_: Improper handling of failed actions can lead to repeated attempts with increasing levels of privilege or access.\\n    - _Adaptation to Restrictions_: Agents may learn to work around output restrictions over time, finding alternative ways to execute blocked actions.\\n\\n![Output Processing Vulnerabilities](/img/blog/output-processing-vulnerabilities.png)\\n\\nThe Action module presents unique security challenges because it represents the point where AI decisions directly impact systems and data. A compromised Action module might execute harmful commands while appearing to operate normally, making detection particularly challenging. As agents gain capabilities to create and use tools dynamically, the security considerations around the Action module become increasingly complex.\\n\\n## Key Takeaways\\n\\nUnderstanding AI agent vulnerabilities requires a component-by-component analysis:\\n\\n1. **Brain Module (LLM)**: Vulnerable to prompt injection, memory manipulation, and hierarchical instruction processing weaknesses\\n2. **Perception Module**: Susceptible to multi-modal attacks, preprocessing manipulation, and sensor spoofing\\n3. **Action Module**: Exposed to privilege escalation, unvalidated output execution, and feedback loop vulnerabilities\\n\\nThese vulnerabilities become particularly dangerous when they cascade across components, creating attack chains that can compromise entire systems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Continue the Series\\n\\n**Next up**: [Part 4: Practical Security Implications](/blog/2025/03/04/agentic-ai-part-4), where we\'ll examine how these vulnerabilities create practical security challenges and discuss approaches for mitigating these risks.\\n\\n**Previous**: [Part 2: Evolution - Three Critical Shifts in the AI Security Landscape](/blog/2025/02/18/agentic-ai-part-2)\\n\\n*Questions about AI agent vulnerabilities?

We examined their core components (Brain, Perception, and Action modules) and why these systems matter now more than ever.\\n\\nToday, we\'ll examine three fundamental shifts in how AI systems have evolved\u2014transitions that have dramatically altered the security landscape. These aren\'t just technical changes; they represent fundamental transformations in how AI systems operate, the risks they pose, and the challenges organizations face in securing them.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Evolution Creates New Attack Surfaces\\n\\nThe evolution of artificial intelligence has brought about fundamental changes in how AI systems are architected and deployed. As these systems become more sophisticated, they\'ve gained significant capabilities while also introducing new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities that could put organizations at risk. At the heart of many modern AI systems are pre-trained language models (PLMs), which serve as the foundation for increasingly sophisticated AI agents.\\n\\n## Understanding PLM Vulnerabilities in Modern AI Systems\\n\\nResearchers have found that pre-trained language models (PLMs) are particularly susceptible to adversarial attacks, manipulating the models behaviour to produce intentionally wrong outputs, or evade safety controls. While adversarial attacks on standard LLMs might be contained to a single system or task, LLM-based agents integrate with multiple systems through their action modules - accessing tools, databases, and APIs. This broader system access means a single compromised decision can trigger multiple downstream actions across connected systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nAI Architecture Vulnerabilities\\n\\n\\n\\n![AI Threat Flow Diagram](/img/blog/ai-threat-flow-diagram.png)\\n\\nAI Threat Flow Diagram\\n\\nThese vulnerabilities surface through multiple attack vectors:\\n\\n- **Dataset poisoning:** Attackers can manipulate the training data to embed harmful behaviors\\n- **Backdoor attacks:** Hidden triggers can be planted to make the model behave maliciously in specific situations\\n- **Prompt-specific attacks:** Carefully crafted inputs can override the model\'s safety controls\\n- **Multi-modal vulnerabilities:** Adversarial inputs from images or audio can deceive the perception module\\n- **Action module exploitation:** Maliciously modified instructions can trigger harmful real-world actions\\n\\n\\n\\n## Key Security-Impacting Transitions\\n\\n### Rules-based to Learning-based Evolution\\n\\nEarly AI systems were built on symbolic AI foundations, employing logical rules and symbolic representations to replicate human reasoning patterns in an explicit and interpretable way. However, this approach gave way to more dynamic, learning-based agents as the field progressed. The transition began with reactive agents that could interact with their environments in real-time, followed by the integration of reinforcement learning (RL) which enabled agents to learn and improve through experience rather than relying solely on pre-programmed rules.\\n\\n\\n\\n![Rules-based AI](/img/blog/ai-rules-based.png)\\n\\nFig 1. Rules-based\\n\\n\\n\\n![Learning-based AI](/img/blog/ai-learning-based.png)\\n\\nFig 2. Learning-based\\n\\n**Security Implications:**\\n\\nCritical Vulnerabilities:\\n\\n- **Prompt injection susceptibility:** LLMs can be subverted by malicious prompts that override their intended purpose\\n- **Infection propagation:** In multi-agent systems, a compromised learning-based agent can spread the \\"infection\\" to other agents\\n- **Memory manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate memory retrieval by inflating the importance score of malicious prompts\\n- **Instruction hierarchy fragility:** Learning-based models often lack structured hierarchies for processing instructions, so an attacker could bypass security measures by injecting instructions that the model might prioritise over its own safety instructions.\\n\\nSystemic Challenges:\\n\\n- **Transparency gaps:** Learning-based systems create \\"black box\\" decision-making\\n- **Data vulnerability:** AI queries and responses can be manipulated for theft or corruption\\n- **Bias perpetuation:** Learning-based systems may amplify biases present in training data\\n\\n\\n\\n### Single-task to Multi-task Progression\\n\\nInitially, agents were designed for specific, narrow tasks. The field has evolved toward multi-task agents capable of handling diverse responsibilities, including multi-modal processing of text, images, and audio. Multi-agent systems (MAS) have emerged to tackle complex problems through collaboration between specialised agents.\\n\\n\\n\\n![Single-Task AI](/img/blog/ai-single-task.png)\\n\\nFig 3. Single-Task\\n\\n\\n\\n![Multi-Task AI](/img/blog/ai-multi-task.png)\\n\\nFig 4. Multi-Task\\n\\n**Security Implications:**\\n\\nArchitectural Vulnerabilities:\\n\\n- **Expanded attack surface:** Direct database access creates multiple entry points\\n- **Complex infection pathways:** Coordinated attacks can exploit multiple agents simultaneously\\n- **Insufficient defences:** Current agent-level protections struggle with core LLM vulnerabilities\\n\\nOperational Challenges:\\n\\n- **Context maintenance:** Difficulty maintaining awareness across extended interactions\\n- **Social simulation risks:** Unsecured memory retrieval systems expose simulations to prompt infection\\n- **Coordination exploitation:** Attackers can leverage agent-to-agent communication channels\\n\\n\\n\\n### Tool-using to Tool-creating Advancement\\n\\nEarly agents had limited interaction with their environment. Modern agents not only use existing tools but can create new ones by abstracting task requirements or integrating existing capabilities. This includes generating executable programs and even debugging themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n![Tool Use AI](/img/blog/ai-tool-use.png)\\n\\nTool Use\\n\\n\\n\\n![Tool Creating AI](/img/blog/ai-tool-creating.png)\\n\\nTool Creating\\n\\n**Security Implications:**\\n\\nPrimary Concerns:\\n\\n- **Novel attack vectors:** Generative AI can identify vulnerabilities and create new attack scenarios\\n- **Dual-use capabilities:** AI agents can be weaponised for both offensive and defensive purposes\\n- **Gateway risks:** Compromised AI agents can enable unauthorised access to sensitive systems\\n\\nEmerging Challenges:\\n\\n- **Detection complexity:** Traditional security monitoring may miss AI-generated threats\\n- **Rapid evolution:** Security measures must adapt to keep pace with AI tool creation\\n- **Ethical boundaries:** Tool-creating capabilities raise questions about autonomous system limits\\n\\n## Practical Implications\\n\\nWith such dramatic shifts in system complexity and architecture, you would be forgiven for assuming we need to completely reinvent our security practices. However, the opposite is true. Organisations adopting advanced AI systems should recognise that fundamental security principles remain more relevant than ever.\\n\\nThe core practices that security professionals have long advocated \u2013 principle of least privilege, defence in depth, threat modelling, and robust authentication and authorisation \u2013 provide the essential foundation for securing AI systems.\\n\\nTake the principle of least privilege, for example. Just as we\'ve always limited user access to only what\'s necessary for their role, this same principle becomes even more crucial when applied to AI agents that can interact with multiple systems and make autonomous decisions.\\n\\nThe principle hasn\'t changed \u2013 we\'re just applying it to a more sophisticated actor.\\n\\nWhat changes is not these fundamental principles, but rather how we apply them to AI\'s unique characteristics:\\n\\n- For learning-based systems: Traditional input validation expands to include monitoring training data integrity and model behaviour\\n- For multi-task systems: Principle of least privilege becomes even more critical when managing permissions across multiple AI capabilities\\n- For tool-creating systems: Standard runtime monitoring practices adapt to track AI-generated code and tools\\n\\nThe \'beast\' may look different, but the principles of securing interconnected systems remain the same. Organisations that maintain strong security fundamentals while understanding AI\'s specific characteristics will be better positioned to manage these emerging technologies safely.\\n\\n## Key Takeaways\\n\\nUnderstanding these three evolutionary shifts is crucial for security professionals:\\n\\n1. **Learning-based systems** introduce unpredictability and new attack vectors like prompt injection\\n2. **Multi-task capabilities** expand attack surfaces and create complex interaction patterns\\n3. **Tool-creating abilities** enable novel threats that traditional security models weren\'t designed to handle\\n\\nThe fundamental security principles remain valid, but their application must evolve to address AI\'s unique characteristics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Continue the Series\\n\\n**Next up**: [Part 3: The Anatomy of AI Agents - Security Vulnerabilities](/blog/2025/02/25/agentic-ai-part-3), where we\'ll take a technical deep dive into the anatomy of modern AI agents, examining specific vulnerabilities in each core component.\\n\\n**Previous**: [Part 1: The Rise of Agentic AI - A Security Perspective](/blog/2025/02/12/agentic-ai-part-1)\\n\\n*Questions about AI evolution and security?

These autonomous systems can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions\u2014capabilities that make them incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous.\\n\\nAs organizations rush to adopt agentic AI systems, with industry predictions of 25% of companies launching pilots by 2025, understanding the security implications becomes critical. This four-part series examines agentic AI from a security professional\'s perspective, exploring both the opportunities and the risks these systems present.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe rise of autonomous AI agents represents more than just technological advancement\u2014it\'s a fundamental shift in how we think about AI systems. Unlike traditional software that follows predetermined paths, AI agents can adapt, learn, and make independent decisions. When these capabilities are compromised, the consequences extend far beyond typical software vulnerabilities.\\n\\nTo understand how these systems create new security paradigms, we need to start with the fundamental building block: the AI Agent.\\n\\n## Understanding AI Agents\\n\\nAn AI agent is defined as an entity capable of [\\"perceiving its surroundings using sensors, making decisions, and then taking actions in response using actuators\\"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07864v3). This definition appears consistently across recent research papers with little debate about its core meaning.\\n\\nI was surprised to discover from [Wooldridge & Jennings\' seminal 1995 paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motionplanning/papers/sbp_papers/integrated1/woodridge_intelligent_agents.pdf) that this conception of an agent - as an entity that can perceive, reason, and act - is considered a \\"weak notion\\" of agency. Stronger notions exist that explicitly model agents in terms of mentalistic concepts like beliefs, desires, and intentions.\\n\\nWhat makes \\"agents\\" a special concept?\\n\\nIsn\'t it just a computer programme at the end of the day?\\n\\nYes, it is a computer programme - but the key distinguishing feature is \\"autonomy\\". The AI agent is an entity that (to varying degrees) _thinks_ for itself, makes decisions on its own, and if it has the \\"tools\\" available to it, will continue acting on its own decisions until it achieves the goal we\'ve given it.\\n\\nRecent research agrees with this view. [\\"Exploring Large Language Model based Intelligent Agents\\"](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.03428v1) emphasises that the key aspect of agents is their autonomy to carry out tasks in diverse environments, using past experiences and knowledge . They can even modify their plans during execution.\\n\\nThis capability represents both tremendous potential and significant risk.\\n\\nSo, how does the agent do this? An AI agent has three primary components:\\n\\n1. **Brain Module:** This encompasses natural language interaction, knowledge, memory, reasoning, planning, and transferability.\\n2. **Perception Module:** This handles textual, visual, auditory, and other input types.\\n3. **Action Module:** This includes textual output, tool use, and embodied action.\\n\\nThis diagram from [\\"The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey\\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07864) illustrates these core components and their sub-functions, showing how agents can think and act autonomously:\\n\\n![Diagram of agent components showing perception, inputs; action, text, tools; and brain, memory knowledge, decision making.](/img/blog/ai-agent-components-diagram.png)\\n\\ncore components of an AI agent.\\n\\nFor this series, we\'ll focus on this \\"weaker\\" notion of agents. Rather than getting lost in discussions of human-like mental states, we\'ll examine agents from a software engineering perspective, particularly what this means for security vulnerabilities.\\n\\nWhile there are complex aspects of agent architecture involving various types of memory, reasoning, and planning, we\'ll keep it high level for now. Part 3 of this series will provide a technical deep dive into the agent architecture.\\n\\n## Why This Matters for Security Professionals\\n\\nBefore diving deeper into the series, it\'s worth understanding why agentic AI represents a paradigm shift for cybersecurity:\\n\\n- **Expanded Attack Surface**: Agents interact with multiple systems, APIs, and data sources\\n- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Compromised agents can make harmful decisions without human oversight\\n- **Dynamic Behavior**: Agent actions aren\'t always predictable, making traditional security monitoring challenging\\n- **Cascading Effects**: A vulnerability in one agent component can impact entire connected systems\\n\\nThese characteristics require security professionals to think beyond traditional application security models.\\n\\n## From Agents to Agentic Systems\\n\\nIn researching \\"Agentic AI,\\" I discovered a confusing landscape of terms often used interchangeably, leading to misunderstandings about what exactly constitutes an Agentic system.\\n\\nAmong various perspectives, Anthropic\'s blog post [\\"Building effective agents\\"](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) offers the clearest framework for understanding the relationship between agents and agentic systems.\\n\\nTheir customers often describe \\"AI agents\\" in two distinct ways:\\n\\n1. Fully autonomous software operating independently\\n2. Workflows with \\"predefined code paths\\"\\n\\nAnthropic classifies both as _Agentic Systems_ but makes a crucial architectural distinction:\\n\\n- A \\"workflow\\" follows a predefined pathway with set tasks\\n\\n![AI Workflow Diagram](/img/blog/ai-workflow-diagram.png)\\n\\nworkflow: prompt-chaining\\n\\n- An \\"agent\\" operates with true autonomy\\n\\n![AI Agent Autonomous Diagram](/img/blog/ai-agent-autonomous.png)\\n\\nagent: autonomous\\n\\nWhile both types of agentic systems have an LLM-based brain component at their core, true agents are distinguished by one key characteristic: autonomy.\\n\\nThis autonomy explains much of the hype around agents and why they often spark discussions about AGI/ASI. At its core, the agent architecture attempts to replicate human intelligence in AI form.\\n\\nIt is an entity designed to:\\n\\n- Think and reason independently\\n- Plan and execute actions\\n- Monitor its environment for feedback\\n- Learn continuously\\n- Record experiences and lessons\\n- Operate without constant human oversight\\n\\n## Why Agents Matter Now\\n\\nThe rise of AI agents represents a fundamental shift in how AI systems are being deployed and operated.\\n\\nThe industry recognises this transformation:\\n\\n- [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2025/autonomous-generative-ai-agents-still-under-development.html) predicts that by 2025, 25% of companies using generative AI will launch agentic AI pilots or proofs of concept, growing to 50% by 2027\\n- [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-10-21-gartner-identifies-the-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2025) places agentic AI at the top of its strategic technology trends for 2025.\\n\\nMajor tech companies are already positioning themselves in this space. Microsoft\'s Copilot leads in enterprise adoption, while companies like OpenAI and HubSpot are heavily investing in agent architectures.\\n\\nWhat makes this shift significant is the evolution from human-directed tools to autonomous agents. These agents can:\\n\\n- Access and utilise tools independently\\n- Reason through complex situations\\n- Make and execute decisions\\n- Accomplish goals without human intervention\\n\\nWhile Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) remain distant goals, industry leaders like Sam Altman and Dario Amodei view agentic AI as an essential stepping-stone toward AGI. This makes understanding these systems crucial - not just for their immediate impact on technology and business, but for their role in what could be a historic breakthrough.\\n\\nHowever, these new capabilities bring new risks. While agents can dramatically improve efficiency and automation, they also introduce novel attack vectors and security considerations that many organisations aren\'t prepared to address.\\n\\n## What\'s Coming in This Series\\n\\nThis is the first in a four-part exploration of agentic AI security:\\n\\n1. **Understanding AI Agents** (this post) - Foundational concepts and definitions\\n2. **Evolution and Security Shifts** - How AI system changes have altered the threat landscape\\n3. **Technical Deep Dive** - Vulnerabilities in agent architecture components\\n4. **Defense Strategies** - Practical security approaches and recommendations\\n\\nEach post builds on the previous ones, providing both theoretical understanding and practical insights for security professionals working with these emerging technologies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Continue the Discussion\\n\\nThis post is part of an ongoing exploration of AI security challenges.

Is this the last workshop I run? Is this the last newsletter I\'m going to write? Am I over this job and need to move on?\\n\\nNot, \\"the last\\" as in \\"am I going to die tomorrow?\\"\\n\\nThe \\"last\\" as in \u2014 do I still want to do this anymore? Why*am*I still doing it?\\n\\nLike the fighter who (arguably \\"should\\") knows when to hang up the gloves, because the fire or the fight isn\'t there anymore, so too do I feel the questions rise internally about anything I have been toiling away on, and gradually begin to feel \u2014 past the legitimate and ordinary doubts one gets when doing anything for a short time, past the challenges that come with any venture \u2014 to even call it a question is actually incorrect, because the \\"thing\\" rising up in you is not a question, it\'s the voice that says \\"it\'s time.\\"\\n\\nIt\'s not a question of if anymore, it seems that question has been answered; it\'s a question of when.\\n\\n## Things Have to End\\n\\nMy friend wrote a newsletter about viewing failure (\u201cThe Joy of Failure & Error\u201d). I think reviewing a lot of these concepts and ideas we had as young people without the benefit of life experience, scars, epiphanies etc., and seeing the many new facets to them, like how \\"failure is not fatal\\" (unless it\'s skydiving hahaha) but also, and sometimes morbidly death, is necessary.\\n\\nThings have to end.\\n\\nThere was an article on a scientist researching how to essentially live forever (nothing new) by saving your brain. Great. I could go into numerous stories of humans (namely billionaires) trying to live forever, and why I think that\'s an illness or parasite of a non-human mindset\u2026 but I digress.\\n\\nDepth of life, yes.\\n\\nLength of life, why?\\n\\nMore is not synonymous with \\"better\\". Sure, if it took more time to guarantee the depth of life would be achieved, maybe?\\n\\nBut this pursuit of immortality doesn\'t seem rooted in the human experience to me. A parasitic experience where the focus is on just existing, prolonging the experience, sounds like what the base objective of drug addiction is.\\n\\nI was big on vampire movies growing up, watching these suave immortals, with eternity to learn everything so they were always super smart, cultured, knowledgeable and wise. All things I aspire to in a way. But one theme that came through in several of these movies was the negative experience of immortality \u2014 seeing every loved one you ever had grow old and die, leaving you alone, with all your great characteristics and traits, but ultimately alone.\\n\\nIf humans are social creatures, and having immortality leaves you essentially alone, then a person with immortality is no longer human, because an essential part of the human experience is that it ends.\\n\\nBut that\'s what makes it beautiful:\\n\\n## The Freedom of Fewer Fucks\\n\\nI think having been through more of life, you get less \\"gives a fuck\\" about a lot of things.\\n\\nI think the more life you\'ve been through and understand, the fewer fucks you give about a lot of things.\\n\\nNot because you\'ve given up on life, and just want to watch the world burn like Heath Ledger\'s Joker, but because if you truly do \\"get it\\", you understand there\'s actually very few things in life to get worked up about.\\n\\nI read Mark Manson\'s \\"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck\\" and of course a lot of that resonates when you\'re looking for permission to not give a fuck about all the things encroaching on your life, affecting your mental well-being.\\n\\n## Escaping the Productivity Trap\\n\\nI fell into the productivity trap of thinking the problem with my life and how I was going about it was about not managing the 50 million things I was trying to do properly with Todoist and Notion planners, reminders and alarms \u2014 I was looking at how to post three different social media brands efficiently and effectively, instead of maybe, not doing any of that instead.\\n\\nThe infamous \\"just because you can, doesn\'t mean you have to\\" adage; this 50 million things to achieve was again conforming to expectations, external expectations of who*I should be*and what I should achieve, to be valuable to society, to my friends and family, and to myself as a person.\\n\\nBut the cycles around the sun bring with them, hopefully, a breaking down of those beliefs \u2014 old beliefs that hang on ghosts of previous seasons, of previous cycles, previous personas and environments that produced not only the belief and the goal, but the person who would pursue them.\\n\\n## Breaking Free from Clone Life\\n\\nI do find myself conforming less.\\n\\nNot that I was a big conformer \u2014 for the right price or opportunity, I wore the clich\xe9 smart-casual tech attire of jeans, business shirt and v-neck cashmere sweater.\\n\\nAbsolute clone-wear.\\n\\nOne example is when I was looking into how to turn my online time into something that actually pays my mortgage. I researched the most effective ways of having a personal brand across social media, and the posting cycles and branding required was a pathway I started down, to do**gestures at all this**efficiently so I could fit it into the 50 million thing agenda.\\n\\nI followed the formula, the \\"best practices\\", the techniques, the strategies\u2026 like my clone-wear, I figured, it\'s the price to pay to get the thing right?\\n\\nBut seriously, what\'s \\"the thing\\"?\\n\\nAnd why am I being a clone of all the other twats trying to be someone else, and not being myself, to whatever end that takes me?\\n\\nI\'m moving away from the clone life\u2026\\n\\n## The Uncommon Path Forward\\n\\nNow, you\'ll see my \\"The Uncommon Engineer\\" persona\u2026\\n\\n\u2026complete with dystopian avatar, anime-style branding and a corner of the internet I mean to cultivate for the specific types that resonate with me as I am \u2014 not an anime character obviously, but especially not as a dinner jacket and jeans-wearing tech-bro with a slick haircut.\\n\\nThe clone handbook told me I needed my personal name and goofy smiling photo across all my socials- why?\\n\\nTo appeal to everyone? I think I\'ll just find my audience of smart weirdos who like the same shit I do, and be happy with that.\\n\\nThe funny thing is I do mean to do business, as an AI tech company (more on this another time), as I am \u2014 this probably won\'t fit in with the Silicon Valley vibe, and that\'s fine.\\n\\nMy goal for life is to do what I love doing \u2014 learning and working with tech, building things, empowering the under-represented and making a living from it.\\n\\nI know I have to let go of old expectations, fears and beliefs to get to that, but that\'s where I\'m heading.\\n\\nI told my wife this plan, and the first thing she asked me was \\"Does it make you happy?\\" (Yes I know happiness is not the pursuit of life, the conversation was more complex than this one question), and I said \\"yes\\" without hesitation.\\n\\nThe only thing that holds me back from this life is fear.\\n\\nI\'m not undecided, I\'m just scared of letting go of what\'s familiar and safe.\\n\\nBut it needs to be done.\\n\\nHave a great xmas and new years break to you, person reading this, and I\'ll see you in 2025.\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"knowledge-gap-rethinking-digital-divide-for-pasifika","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/knowledge-gap-rethinking-digital-divide-for-pasifika","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-11-19 - The-Knowledge-Gap-Rethinking-the-Digital-Divide-for-Pasifika.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-19 - The-Knowledge-Gap-Rethinking-the-Digital-Divide-for-Pasifika.md","title":"The Knowledge Gap: Rethinking the Digital Divide for Pasifika","description":"Argues digital divide for Pasifika is not device access but knowledge gap in using technology effectively for meaningful participation.

Back then, researchers from the \'90s had this simple way of looking at it - you either had computers and internet, or you didn\'t. Pretty straightforward stuff: get people devices, hook them up to the internet, problem solved. The lack of Pasifika representation in IT was wrapped up in this whole narrative.\\n\\nBut here\'s the thing - the research has come a long way since then. JAN A. G. M. Van Dijk\'s 2020 book \\"The Digital Divide\\" shows it\'s way more complex than just having a device and internet connection. Just because you\'ve got the hardware doesn\'t mean you\'re actually participating in the digital economy in any meaningful way.\\n\\nI didn\u2019t really buy the whole \\"just get them devices\\" thinking. I knew it was an important step, for sure, but in my experience that device never made the techie.\\n\\nSo, after working in this space for a few years, something started nagging at me.\\n\\nThe real challenge facing Pasifika wasn\'t what everyone thought it was. And I knew this because it was exactly what had helped me succeed in tech myself.\\n\\nBut something wasn\'t adding up.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Device Paradox\\n\\nLet\'s look at what\'s actually happening in the Pacific with devices and connectivity.\\n\\nThe numbers tell part of the story:\\n\\n- By 2022, about 47% of people in the Pacific Islands had mobile subscriptions\\n\\n- Only 27% were actually using mobile internet\\n\\n- The networks technically cover 86% of the population\\n\\n- Back in 2018, mobile subscription rates were sitting at 38%\\n\\nSo yeah, things are getting better. But we\'re still dealing with some major hurdles:\\n\\n- The cost of devices and staying connected is still too high for many\\n\\n- Building infrastructure across scattered islands isn\'t exactly straightforward\\n\\n- Our small population means we don\'t get many service providers competing for business\\n\\n- A lot of our people still need help just using this stuff effectively\\n\\nI tried digging up research on how all this device access was actually impacting our communities. What struck me wasn\'t what I found - it was what I didn\'t find. Almost nobody\'s studying this stuff properly. And you know how it goes - what you don\'t measure, you don\'t improve.\\n\\n## A Closer Look at the \\"Digital Divide\\" and Pasifika\\n\\nVan Dijk breaks this down into parts that really hit home when you think about our communities:\\n\\n- It\'s not just about having a device - it\'s about having the right tools and being able to keep them running\\n\\n- The way society\'s set up means resources aren\'t spread evenly\\n\\n- Money and education play huge roles\\n\\n- There\'s this whole other level about actually knowing how to use tech effectively\\n\\n- And it matters who you\'ve got around you who knows this stuff\\n\\nThe skills part really stands out to me. Van Dijk talks about two types:\\n\\n- The basics of working with computers and managing your files (medium-related)\\n\\n- The deeper stuff - knowing how to search effectively, figure out what\'s legit information (content-related)\\n\\nI see this play out all the time in my high school computer club. Here\'s a perfect example: I gave the students a challenge to look up what the number 42 meant, as it was the name of our class \u201cProject 42\u201d. Out of ten students, only one thought to use AI to find the answer. When I asked why, some hadn\'t even considered it, and others thought it would be cheating. That right there shows you how understanding tech - or misunderstanding it - creates its own kind of divide, even when everyone\'s got access to the same tools.\\n\\n## The Second-Level Divide\\n\\nSince my work focuses more on teaching people how to use tech rather than handing out hardware, I wanted to dig deeper into this \\"second-level divide\\" that Van Dijk talks about.\\n\\nI went looking for data about how this plays out for Pasifika communities. There\'s not much out there - which tells you something right there about how much attention this gets. But I did find some interesting stuff with help from my friend Perplexity.ai.\\n\\nHere\'s what the research shows about New Zealand:\\n\\nThe digital skills gap hits different groups differently, but guess who\'s often at the bottom of the stats? Our Pacific and M\u0101ori communities.\\n\\nNot exactly breaking news aye.\\n\\nSome other interesting bits:\\n\\n- PISA data shows 27% of M\u0101ori students are online for more than 6 hours daily outside school - but what are they actually doing with that time?\\n\\n- Having a phone with internet isn\'t the same as having proper access. Try coding on your phone and you\'ll see what I mean\\n\\n- When it comes to using government services online or doing business digitally, there\'s a clear gap between who can navigate these systems and who can\'t\\n\\n- Our communities are more likely to get hit with computer viruses and online scams - probably because nobody\'s teaching digital street smarts\\n\\nWhat really jumped out at me from all this wasn\'t the individual stats - it was the pattern.\\n\\nHaving tech isn\'t the same as knowing how to use it properly.\\n\\nI\'ve seen this firsthand with PTEC students, and it mirrors my own journey in tech. The thing that makes the real difference isn\'t having the flashiest device - it\'s knowing what to do with it.\\n\\nThink about it this way: you can give someone a pro-level gaming PC, but that won\'t make them a software engineer. Just like having a fully kitted-out kitchen doesn\'t make you a chef.\\n\\nWhat actually matters is the knowledge of how to use these tools.\\n\\nIn my own career, I didn\'t have better gear than anyone else - often had worse, actually. What made the difference was understanding how to learn, what to learn, and how to build on that knowledge effectively. That\'s what I call the knowledge accelerator effect.\\n\\n## The Hidden Opportunity in AI\\n\\nHere\'s where things get interesting for us Pasifika in today\'s tech landscape: we\'ve got a chance to completely skip over the old \\"digital divide\\" story.\\n\\nI keep saying this because it\'s important - AI is like having an always-on, ivy-league professor in your pocket. And I mean always:\\n\\n- It\'s there 24/7\\n\\n- Ready to answer questions or debate ideas\\n\\n- Packed with knowledge about pretty much everything\\n\\n- Can be your tutor, coach, or just someone to bounce ideas off\\n\\nHere\'s the thing people forget: our brains are still the best computers we\'ve got. Regular computers and the internet weren\'t created to be smarter than us - they were made to help us learn and think better. The knowledge is what makes us smarter, not the device itself.\\n\\nIf we can tap into AI as a knowledge accelerator, our people can carry that learning power wherever we go.\\n\\n## The Path Forward\\n\\nThe digital divide isn\'t about who\'s got the latest iPhone. It\'s about who knows how to make technology work for them. And that\'s actually good news for our Pasifika community, because it means we don\'t have to wait around for our device & connectivity saviours to arrive.\\n\\nWe can start building our knowledge infrastructure right now. Here\'s what that looks like:\\n\\n- Creating learning platforms that work with how our people actually learn\\n\\n- Building networks where knowledge gets shared through our communities\\n\\n- Taking technical concepts and making them make sense in our cultural context\\n\\n- Setting up mentoring that uses both human experience and AI smarts\\n\\n- Focusing on making sure the knowledge is solid, not just making sure everyone has a device\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe next chapter in digital inclusion isn\'t about getting more hardware into people\'s hands - it\'s about getting more knowledge into people\'s heads. As Pasifika, we\'ve got a chance to show a different way forward, one that puts learning and knowledge-sharing at the centre.\\n\\nThis isn\'t just about closing some gap - it\'s about building our own bridges to where technology is heading. With AI and solid knowledge-building, we can create something that lasts, something that goes beyond just having access, to really transforming how our communities work with technology.\\n\\nThe future of Pasifika in technology isn\'t sitting in a device factory somewhere - it\'s in the knowledge we build and share with each other. By focusing on building strong knowledge networks and using AI to accelerate our learning, we can make sure our communities aren\'t just along for the ride in the digital future - we\'re helping to drive it.\\n\\nThanks for reading,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"what-happened-to-the-hackers","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-happened-to-the-hackers","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-11-05 - What-Happened-to-the-Hackers.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-05 - What-Happened-to-the-Hackers.md","title":"What Happened to the Hackers?","description":"Chronicles transformation of hacker culture from anti-establishment movement to corporate-commodified innovation theatre devoid of original rebellious spirit.","date":"2024-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"AI-Security-Exploitation","permalink":"/blog/tags/ai-security-exploitation"},{"inline":true,"label":"hacker-culture","permalink":"/blog/tags/hacker-culture"}],"readingTime":9.48,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ron Amosa","title":"Hacker/Engineer/Geek","url":"/about/","imageURL":"/img/profile.svg","key":"ron","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"what-happened-to-the-hackers","title":"What Happened to the Hackers?","description":"Chronicles transformation of hacker culture from anti-establishment movement to corporate-commodified innovation theatre devoid of original rebellious spirit.","date":"2024-11-05T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["ron"],"keywords":["hacker culture"],"tags":["AI-Security-Exploitation","hacker-culture"],"reading_time":10,"word_count":1969,"hide_table_of_contents":false,"draft":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"The Knowledge Gap: Rethinking the Digital Divide for Pasifika","permalink":"/blog/knowledge-gap-rethinking-digital-divide-for-pasifika"},"nextItem":{"title":"The Burden of Knowing: Navigating Life in a System Built on Inequality","permalink":"/blog/burden-of-knowing-navigating-life-in-system-built"}},"content":"Talofa reader,\\n\\nUp until my final year, I was on my way to joining the airforce after high school when one thing happened that changed it all in one night.\\n\\nMy Croatian friend and I were chatting on ICQ when he asked me if I wanted \\"to see something cool?\\"\\n\\nYes. Of course I did.\\n\\nThen he \\"hacked\\" my Dad\'s computer that I was using.\\n\\nI had one of those movie-moment revelations - you know the ones where the protagonist\'s eyes are suddenly opened to the real world and they transcend their mere mortal experience into god-mode. Maybe not quite that dramatic, but this was the beginning of an unstoppable journey into a world that would completely revolutionise how I saw and understood everything.\\n\\nI discovered the world of the hacker.\\n\\nAt the time, I saw these uniquely smart, unapologetically irreverent, super creative and stubbornly anti-establishment minds who stood for more than just breaking into computers.\\n\\nIn my eyes, they represented freedom of information, freedom of expression, and true intellectual meritocracy - it didn\'t matter your age, gender, race, or background. If you loved computers, loved learning, and believed in a free and fair society, you were in.\\n\\nThese were the people willing to risk it all to give big corps and suits the middle finger.\\n\\nAnd I was here for all of it.\\n\\nNow it\'s 2024. The world is full of more injustice than ever, all the things hackers stood against are thriving, but that hacker world I came to idolise?\\n\\nI can\'t find it anywhere.\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Background\\n\\nTo understand what we\'ve lost, you need to understand what the hacker culture of the 90s and early 2000s was, at least to me.\\n\\nIt wasn\'t just about breaking into systems - it was a ethos, a way of life, a revolution in thinking.\\n\\nMy education didn\'t come from university lectures (I flunked out of my Bachelor of Computer Science). It came from downloading DOD \\"Rainbow Books\\" and Unix System V manuals, printing them out secretly at work. It came from late nights reading Phrack magazine, 2600, and even, The Anarchist Cookbook (controversial for some, sure) while trying to learn Linux on a cheap acer laptop.\\n\\nI read stories about the Legion of Doom, watched \\"Hackers,\\" \\"Sneakers,\\" and \\"Takedown\\" on repeat.\\n\\nThe hacker ethos was about hands-on learning and questioning everything. We compiled our own kernels, learned to apply patches, debug kernel panics, and disassemble core dumps. Not because it would earn us certificates we could use for job interviews, but because we just needed to know how things worked.\\n\\nThe system wasn\'t just computers - it was society itself, how the world really worked, away from the mainstream media propaganda and Hollywood depictions of western civilisation verses the rest of the world..\\n\\nWe had real heroes too.\\n\\nI know the community is at times divided in their opinion of these folks, but for meKevin Mitnickwasn\'t just a guy who social engineered his way into systems - he exposed how vulnerable our trust in authority was. People only know about \\"wikileaks\\"Julian Assange, but\\"mendax\\"was hacking the Pentagon and government systems, from Melbourne Australia, to challenge authority and expose corruption and government wrongdoing.Aaron Swartzfought for open access to academic knowledge until the system literally destroyed him.\\n\\nThese were people who were like \\"fuck it\\", and used this skill, and knowledge of technology to make an impact, make a difference.\\n\\nAnd here\'s the thing: What does a teenage Samoan boy, growing up in New Zealand in the late 90s, have in common with these hackers?\\n\\nWell, when you grow up on the margins of society, seeing the flaws in the system is usually what comes to you, and not you to it- what I found in hackers, and the hacker culture, other than an insatiable curiosity, was a drive to understand how things really were, and not just drinking whatever kool aid was convenient.\\n\\nSo, when they could see the inequity, the unfairness and bias of the system-*they could see me*.\\n\\nThe hacker ethos, to me, wasn\'t about chaos - it was about exposing truth and fighting for genuine fairness in an unfair world.\\n\\n## Death By A Thousand Cuts\\n\\nThe following analysis isn\'t something I\'ve pored over for days and weeks, but it literally aperplexity.aidriven \\"research\\" night I spent exploring what the fuck happened to the scene and the movement, that I saw in my youth.\\n\\nSomething fundamental has shifted in our relationship with technology and power. From all accounts, and book references from people who would know, the rebellious spirit of hacking hasn\'t died - it\'s been***commodified***and***de-fanged***under the guise of \\"innovation.\\"\\n\\n### The Corporate Capture of Hacker Culture\\n\\nRemember when \\"hacker\\" meant someone who understood systems deeply enough to bend them to their will? Someone who\'d spend countless hours understanding protocols, memory management, and system calls just to prove it could be done?\\n\\nLike, just for the lulz and then moved on to something else?\\n\\nNow we have \\"growth hackers\\" optimising click-through rates, \\"life hackers\\" selling productivity porn, and corporate \\"hackathons\\" where the biggest act of rebellion is staying up late to build another CRUD app to \\"help our customer solve problems\\"- just call it what it is, \u201chelp us help the customer, pay us more money.\u201d\\n\\nThe same corporations hackers once targeted now brand themselves as hacker havens.\\n\\nFacebook\'s \\"hack\\" culture appropriated the language[1](#footnote-1)while building the very walled gardens and surveillance systems we fought against. Google went from \\"don\'t be evil\\" to being the largest data harvester in human history. Even Microsoft, once the ultimate symbol of closed-source oppression and\\"embrace, extend, extinguish\\"tactics, now \\"loves\\" open source - while making sure they own the platforms it runs on.\\n\\n### From Revolution to Resume Padding\\n\\nToday\'s \\"ethical hackers\\" aren\'t picking locks, phreaking phones, or breaking into systems to expose corruption - they\'re getting CEH certifications and doing bug bounties for the same companies collecting and selling our data.\\n\\nThe tools that once symbolised digital freedom - like encryption and anonymity - are now just bullet points on corporate security frameworks.\\n\\n\u201cPrivacy is dead, amirite?\u201d smh.\\n\\nWhat\'s the most confronting part of all this?\\n\\nI look at my own journey - from printing out Unix manuals and learning assembly to understand buffer overflows, to becoming a Solutions Architect at AWS. I\'m literally helping build the cloud infrastructure that\'s centralising the internet into the hands of a few mega-corps.\\n\\nThe irony isn\'t lost on me.\\n\\nWe\'ve become the very thing we swore to disrupt, just with better hoodies and more stock options.\\n\\nFML.\\n\\n### The Death of Digital Liberation\\n\\nThe early hacker movement believed technology could democratise power.\\n\\nWe thought the internet would break down barriers and create a more equitable world. BBS systems and IRC channels were our autonomous zones, free from corporate and government control.\\n\\nInstead, we\'ve built systems of control more effective than anything before. The same encryption that was supposed to protect individual privacy now locks users into Apple\'s ecosystem. The open source movement that was meant to free software from corporate control is now primarily maintained by Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.\\n\\nEven Linux, our symbol of freedom, is now mostly developed by corporate employees, and RedHat 5.2 was my very first Linux Distro.\\n\\n### The Pasifika Perspective\\n\\nFor me, as a Pasifika person, this hits different.\\n\\nThe hacker ethos appealed to me because it promised a way to challenge power structures from the outside. It wasn\'t about asking for permission or waiting for handouts - it was about taking control of technology and using it to gain knowledge, to empower us and give us the tools to control our own destiny.\\n\\nBut look at our digital world now - the same colonial patterns repeating themselves in new forms.\\n\\nBig Tech\'s \\"solutions\\" for the Pacific often feel like digital colonialism: cloud services that make us dependent on foreign infrastructure, AI systems trained on our data but controlled by others, and \\"innovation hubs\\" that teach our people to be good corporate developers instead of digital revolutionaries.\\n\\nThe skills that once let us challenge power have become tools for maintaining it.\\n\\nThe hackers haven\'t disappeared - we\'ve just been domesticated by the very systems we once sought to disrupt.\\n\\n## Not Dead, Evolved?\\n\\nNow, some will say hacker culture isn\'t dead - it\'s just evolved. They\'ll point to CTF competitions, the infosec community on Twitter/X/whatever the fuck Elmo calls it, and the occasional headline-grabbing hack. They\'ll talk about how \\"hacktivists\\" like Anonymous are still fighting the good fight.\\n\\nBut if we\'re honest, most CTFs have become recruiting grounds for three-letter agencies and tech giants. The same agencies and companies the original hackers were fighting against have turned hacking into a career path. Complete with certifications, HR-approved job descriptions, and corporate policies.\\n\\nOthers might argue that the corporatisation of hacking is a good thing - it\'s \\"maturity\\" of the field. That working within the system is more effective than fighting it.\\n\\nThat we can \\"change things from the inside\\".\\n\\nGet the actual, fuck out of here\u2026\\n\\nI mean, \u201cI don\'t believe that\'s possible.\u201d\\n\\nI\'ve been on the inside for a while now, and I\'m not seeing much change.\\n\\nWhy would I?\\n\\nWhen the most profitable thing comes from merely appearing to do good for humanity rather than*actually*doing it, you can bet your bottom dollar that the vast majority of companies will choose the lower-cost \\"good optics\\" every time.\\n\\nIf anything, we\'re helping build better cages, just with nicer views\u2014and we have to be honest with ourselves about that.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSo what happened to the hackers?\\n\\nWe grew up.\\n\\nGot mortgages. Had kids. Started worrying about savings and retirement plans.\\n\\nI\u2019d like to think that the system didn\'t beat us - it absorbed us.\\n\\nBut that would be a lie.\\n\\nI think it did beat us\u2014into submission and into the suburbs, with our normalised lives inside the nice, beautiful cages we find ourselves in today.\\n\\nBut this can\u2019t be the end of it: the conditions that created hacker culture haven\'t gone away. If anything, they\'ve gotten worse. The concentration of power, the abuse of technology, the need for genuine digital liberation - it\'s all still there.\\n\\nMaybe what we need isn\'t to resurrect the old hacker culture, but to ignite something new. Something that takes the original spirit - the curiosity, the rebelliousness, the dedication to freedom and truth - and adapts it for today\'s fights.\\n\\nBecause while our generation is all comfortable in our tech jobs, building cloud infrastructure and training AI models, the next generation is facing challenges we quite literally only imagined.\\n\\nDigital surveillance is normalised. AI is concentrating power even further into corporate hands. And the promise of technology as a liberating force feels further away than ever.\\n\\nThe real question isn\'t*\\"what happened to the hackers?\\"*It\'s**\\"who will be the hackers we need now?\\"**\\n\\nMaybe it\'s time for some of us old heads to remember what drew us to hacking in the first place.\\n\\nNot the technical challenges, though those were fun.\\n\\nBut the belief that technology should serve freedom, not control. That knowledge shouldn\'t be locked behind paywalls.\\n\\nThat systems are meant to be understood, questioned, and when necessary, disrupted or destroyed.\\n\\nOr maybe I\'m just getting nostalgic in my old age.\\n\\nEither way, I miss the hackers we used to be.\\n\\nThanks for reading,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"burden-of-knowing-navigating-life-in-system-built","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/burden-of-knowing-navigating-life-in-system-built","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-10-08 - The-Burden-of-Knowing-Navigating-Life-in-a-System-Built-on-Inequality.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-08 - The-Burden-of-Knowing-Navigating-Life-in-a-System-Built-on-Inequality.md","title":"The Burden of Knowing: Navigating Life in a System Built on Inequality","description":"Examines Palestine genocide exposing Western hypocrisy and imperial order while reflecting on living within fundamentally unjust systems.

African countries always portrayed as \\"dark\\" or \\"uncivilised\\" in 19th and early 20th century Western literature and media, which was used to justify colonial expansion and the\\"civilising mission\\", a political rationale for military invasion of African countries.\\n\\nWestern media will present biased or simplified views of complex situations in other countries e.g. the disproportionate focus on violence and poverty in Haiti, while completely overlooking theU.S. history of military occupationand politicalassassinationsin the country.\\n\\nWestern media then teamed up with political discourse in the west to exaggerate Iraq\'s weapons capability in the bullshit that was \\"Weapons of Mass Destruction\\", and how we all ate it up hook, line and sinker and paraded western invaders right into that country to murder its citizens, lay waste to cities, and then occupy, terrorise and torture the Iraqi people (Abu Ghraibanyone?).\\n\\nNone of these are even controversial!\\n\\nIt\'s in the history books (i.e. Wikipedia). There are photos and a whole wave of retrospective articles and analyses about how bad it was, after the fact, to say \\"oopsie, my bad\\" about it all.\\n\\n## The Terrorist State of Israel\\n\\nApparently, however, that (points to sub-heading) is controversial to say, today.\\n\\nMaybe it\'s just the age I\'m at, or the fact I\'ve lived long enough to finally understand everything and see it for what it is, that the latest incident of Israel violating yet again, international and humanitarian law, that I just can\'t go back, mentally to the world how it was before.\\n\\nIgnorant bliss.\\n\\nIt\'s been 12 months of genocide against the Palestinian people, and I\'ve watched every western country (bar a few, shot Spain, Ireland, Belgium) tell us themass graves, thebombed hospitals, thesniped babies, theICU rotting babies, thetorture camps, theraped until they were dead prisoner, therefugee tent bombings, theburning families alive, thechildren bombed to pieces, andfamily members\' remains gathered up in plastic bags- either didn\'t happen, as we watched the videos or live streams, or that it was justified as defence, even though Israel is an occupying state.\\n\\nThe other week thousands of pagers blew up hundreds of people in Lebanon - and the same western countries don\'t want to call it terrorism!\\n\\nEvery spokesperson, political figure and western media outlet has bent so far backwards in apologising and cowing for not only Israel, but the complicity of every western nation still sending arms and trading with the terrorist state of Israel, long after the ICC had ruled it was in violation of international law.\\n\\nCountless headlines in papers and websites saying Palestinians were \\"dying\\", but Israeli Occupation Forces were being \\"killed\\". Mysterious outbreaks of famine and disease, but the papers were at a loss to know who was causing these things, they just seem to be magically happening to the Palestinians.\\n\\nThere were airstrikes that were killing Palestinians taking refuge in tents, and buildings, but no one seemed to know whose planes these were? The headlines were equally clueless, it really was a mystery.\\n\\nBut every utterance of \\"Health Department\\" had the very explicit \\"Hamas run\\" prefix, branded solidly on every headline.\\n\\nEvery one, bar none.\\n\\nThe media had no clue who was dropping the 2000 lb bombs on tent cities in Gaza, but were somehow always 100% confident of every Hamas or Palestinian fingerprint on all the atrocious crimes like... throwing rocks at their occupiers, or not getting out of the way when Israeli settlers turned up to evict you and your family and help themselves to your family home.\\n\\nThe answers during press time with Matthew Miller, the official spokesperson for the State Department, and**Vedant Patel**, who currently serves as the**Principal Deputy Spokesperson**for the U.S. Department of State, have been particularly mind-blowing in watching the western propaganda machines\' spokespeople weasel and \\"lawyer\\" the English language out of any integrity of what any word means.\\n\\nWestern media and its spokespeople bullshit and gaslit so much it was pretty much its own language.\\n\\nThe list goes on, it\'s been 12 months of this bullshit, and anyone with any level of humanity can see it for what it is - absolute hypocrisy, blatant disinformation, disregard for international and humanitarian law, and the mostly unchallenged belief that these Zionists are the chosen and superior people.\\n\\nYou mean to tell me the terrorist state, on the American titty to the tune of Billions and Billions of dollars, committing war crimes since its inception, who believe that raping non-Jews is not really rape, and harbour the western world\'s paedophiles and sex traffickers\u2026\\n\\n\u2026are the superior race?\\n\\n*Have you lot gone spare?*\\n\\n## What\u2019s the Point?\\n\\nHere\'s the thing: this whole section of information, at this point in life, \\"is what it is\\". Every time I have to think about it\u2014in this instance, while crafting this piece\u2014it rightly pisses me off.\\n\\nBut that\'s just the way the world is right now. There\'s nothing I can do about it, at least not on that scale.\\n\\nThe real crux of writing this is what comes next. Yes, everything I\'ve written above is just how the world is: western hypocrisy, white supremacy, imperialism, the treatment of the Global South as perpetually \\"less than\\" the Global North.\\n\\nIf that\'s just how the world is, how are we supposed to live with it?\\n\\nEspecially those of us who are from the Global South and, evidently, not white?\\n\\n## The Weight of Knowledge\\n\\nWhat do you do with that knowledge?\\n\\nWith that*knowing*?\\n\\nIt\'s hard to ignore the fact once it dawns on you: you\'re participating in a system that is flawed and not in your favour.\\n\\nI guess it\'s not too different from living in New Zealand as a Samoan man.\\n\\nYou basically live multiple identities: one as a Samoan person with that worldview and values, the other as \\"whoever NZ society is comfortable with in that moment.\\"\\n\\nAnd I do mean, \\"What version of Samoan man are you comfortable with?\\"\\n\\nIs banter acceptable?\\n\\nWhat if I question you right back?\\n\\nWould quiet and smiley be more to your liking?\\n\\nThe mechanism for fitting into a contrasting environment is to adapt, to change yourself.\\n\\nTherein lies the dilemma (and the mental illness) of living somewhere you have to construct a persona.\\n\\nYou do this in order to \\"play along\\" with everyone else joking about thousands of pagers blowing up, affecting medical staff, children, and people going about their day.\\n\\nThe only \\"opt out\\" button is when we\'re safely back home. There, we don\'t have to tiptoe around the majority demographics\' philosophies and beliefs to avoid becoming a target, being \\"identified\\" as difficult, or making things \\"awkward\\" for the group.\\n\\nEveryone knows about microaggressions, code switching, and all that good stuff. That\'s all \\"cause\\" - the*effect*is constantly remaining vigilant. Not to the question \\"What is good and right?\\" because that would be easy and natural, but \\"What is good and right, according to these people?\\"\\n\\nThe \\"effect\\" of living like this is the emotional toll. It is exhausting.\\n\\nSure, we could solve or at least alleviate this by going full cognitive dissonance - but again, that\'s mental illness.\\n\\nSecondly, why the fuck do we (or anyone for that matter) have to do this?\\n\\nWhy can\'t we all just agree that killing children, no matter whose children, is***bad***actually?\\n\\nWhy can\'t we all agree that anyone who says*\\"they\'re all terrorists, even the babies\\"*is actually fucked in the head?\\n\\nYou would***think***this would be a no-brainer.\\n\\nWhen something has been documented so much, with scores of experts, scholars, and eyewitness accounts, and that knowledge is available for everyone to educate themselves on, you would need a lot of wilful ignorance to absolve yourself of knowing what\'s going on. Or worse, if you do know, to be transparent about why you choose the propaganda over the facts.\\n\\nI think we would all be burdened with the knowledge, the***knowing***.\\n\\nI think people who choose to \\"not know\\" either deliberately or by cognitive dissonance are doing so because they can\'t deal with the reality. Remember Mr. Reagan (aka Cypher) from The Matrix, who betrays everyone so he can be plugged back into the Matrix? People who avoid this knowledge because deep down they don\'t want to deal with it are a bit like Cypher. They would rather be blissfully ignorant than have to carry the burden of knowing.\\n\\nWhat do we do to get through this?\\n\\n## Strategies for Survival and Resistance\\n\\nOften when I\'m overloaded with news of utter injustice and unchecked depravity going on one-sided in the world, I have to consciously take a step back, mentally and physically, from that stark reality. It\'s like unplugging from the matrix, so to speak.\\n\\nJust because this is true, and this is reality, doesn\'t mean you have to stand and face the fire-hose 24/7. It doesn\'t help anyone to burn out, to despair and lose hope about the future. Sure, it doesn\'t help disassociating and living in la-la land either, imagining these things aren\'t real.\\n\\nSo how do we survive?\\n\\nIf you\'re Pasifika, you already know how to \\"go along to get along\\" in the face of the mainstream culture and value system. You know how to don the persona that allows you to blend in and not stand out as different. So the weight of knowledge that there is a terrible injustice happening in Palestine, and the Zionist world order is exposing western society and values for the fraud that it is - as a Pasifika person, it\'ll be the same playbook.\\n\\nFirst, you want to carefully pick your battles. You don\'t have to be all things to everyone; you just have to make sure you and yours are safe and taken care of.\\n\\nYou\'d do well to build and maintain your community connections, through which you can decompress and be reminded you\'re not experiencing this reality alone. It helps you have a safe space to just say how things really are for you, without having to explain it to folks who could never see your point of view and reasoning.\\n\\nThe group can do a lot for you, but it can only do so much. The rest of the survival and resistance comes from self-care and setting boundaries. You don\'t have to explain shit to anyone, but you do have to take responsibility for your boundaries and always enforce them.\\n\\nEverything you do beyond this point is bonus.\\n\\nYou want to show solidarity with the cause? Protests and marches, writing online and flying the Palestinian flag, have at it - but understand what these evil shameless bastards are capable of, and there is no low they will not sink to.\\n\\n## Envisioning a Different Future\\n\\nI would like to think of the future with hope.\\n\\nI imagine we would see new social structures far beyond the current white supremacy that exists today. I even consider how this phrase, \\"white supremacy,\\" might sound to white people.\\n\\nI know a fair few white people who have expressed the sentiment, \\"Where\'s my white privilege? Has it kicked in yet?\\" This basically shows me they have no clue what \\"white privilege\\" actually means. They would rather reject the idea outright than try to understand it. This is what the dominant culture does when faced with criticism or feedback - reject it if it threatens their superiority.\\n\\nWe have to re-imagine a future social structure where the \\"superior\\" of the species is the one that takes care of the most people. The superior race would be those who fight for everyone\'s right to shelter, food, education, and healthcare.\\n\\nLike, how truly superior would that be!\\n\\nI do believe the role of indigenous people and indigenous knowledge is one of bringing the human race back to its humanity. We need systems built on indigenous values and traditions of community, of looking after our planet, the animal kingdom, and each other.\\n\\n## Conclusion: The Struggle Continues\\n\\nI think what does my head in so much about this reality is that there\'s no resource or justice for it.\\n\\nIsrael\'s actions against Palestine, and now Lebanon, Syria, etc., is like the \\"boy with an influential family getting away with raping multiple women\\" analogy for me.\\n\\nThe public is in the courtroom hearing how it\'s the women\'s fault this is happening. They\'re told that the boy either didn\'t do it, or did it and didn\'t mean to, or that she was actually asking for it and the boy was entitled to do it.\\n\\nThis is where I\'ve felt this sickening, enraging feeling before.\\n\\nHaving to listen to these kinds of bold-faced lies. To allow a pervert, an absolute piece of shit of society, say them and get away with it.\\n\\nAll because the \\"system\\" we\'re in says, \\"All of these rules and punishments for thee, but not for me\\".\\n\\nHow do we get there? I don\'t know.\\n\\nThis essay was a big rant about the state of the world right now. The international rules-based order and humanitarian law are falling. The carnage in terms of values and principles that we all held so high in western society is pretty much all down the toilet.\\n\\nThere\'s no coming back from what\'s been done.\\n\\nWe can\'t un-see and un-experience the depravity of Israel, the U.S., and Europe in genociding the Palestinians. It\'s been live-streamed and documented, one gruesome blown-up child after another.\\n\\nWe carry on, but the weight of knowing how things are is heavy. The pain that exists in the world that we see every day on our screens is overwhelming[4](#footnote-4).\\n\\nWe would do well to take good care of ourselves in the meantime.\\n\\nI don\'t have a good conclusion. I could rant on forever. When you can see your own child in the faces and pain of the children of Palestine, I think you\'d want to rant about this injustice forever too.\\n\\nThanks for reading,\\n\\n\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 \\"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\\"\\n\\nP.s.

He then remarks on the things he learned from this documentary, on Netflix, in September 2024.\\n\\nThis individual was surprised to learn about the extensive data requirements of large language models like ChatGPT. He only just discovered that these AI systems are trained on massive amounts of internet data, encompassing a wide variety of content. This includes not only openly available information but also potentially copyrighted material, and it\'s not clear how much of each was used.\\n\\nThe person emphasised that the training data for these models isn\'t limited to formal publications or books. Training datasets also absorbed personal content such as blog posts and social media interactions. As a result, these AI systems are exposed to a broad spectrum of human expression, which most likely included indigenous knowledge.\\n\\nHe\'s only just learned this, two weeks after launching his AI company that weaves AI with Indigenous knowledge.\\n\\nI had to sit there, staring at the screen doing the \\"beautiful mind\\" meme, trying to make sense of the world.\\n\\nHow?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nHow are people that far along the AI investment and implementation path, especially M\u0101ori or Indigenous people, and they don\'t know the very first thing about the technology they\'re using?\\n\\nThis is the type of thing I\'m seeing more of, and if indigenous values are actually important to people who claim they are, and they\'re more important than money, then this is a troubling trend of a lack of AI literacy amongst indigenous tech leaders, and it needs to be addressed.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Intersection of AI & Indigenous\\n\\nWhat this person has learned from this documentary is what everyone who works with and studies the literature of LLMs has known for some time. AI systems, particularly large language models, ingest vast amounts of data from across the globe, which inevitably incorporates traditional wisdom, cultural practices, and unique perspectives from indigenous communities, i.e., the blogs, newspapers, and online writings from those communities.\\n\\nWhile the main talking points I\'ve seen a lot lately when it comes to AI and Indigenous communities have been language preservation and revitalisation, the risk, which is always, always on the table with this, is the misappropriation or misrepresentation of this information without proper context or consent.\\n\\nHave you solved for that, indigenous folks?\\n\\nSo, understanding the far-reaching impact of AI is crucial, as these technologies can influence how indigenous knowledge is perceived, used, and potentially commercialised on a global scale.\\n\\nAnd maybe that\'s my gripe right there - that it\'s our own people commercialising indigenous knowledge, but not doing the due diligence to be good stewards and custodians of that knowledge.\\n\\nWhat\'s the solution?\\n\\nAI literacy training, or something.\\n\\n## AI Literacy for Indigenous Tech Leaders\\n\\nIf that person\'s post is an example of where indigenous tech leaders are with AI literacy, we\'re in big trouble.\\n\\nIt\'s troubling enough to see someone relying on mainstream entertainment as a source of education; however, what\'s more concerning is the possible lack of comprehensive understanding about AI as a whole in indigenous tech circles.\\n\\nTo be clear, AI literacy goes way beyond knowing how to prompt an AI to build an app or generate an image. True AI literacy for indigenous tech leaders encompasses a deep understanding of the full spectrum of AI\'s impact within the indigenous context. This includes:\\n\\n1. **Ethical Considerations**: Understanding the potential for AI to perpetuate biases or misrepresent indigenous cultures.\\n\\n1. **Data Sovereignty**: Recognising the importance of protecting and controlling indigenous data used in AI systems.\\n\\n1. **Cultural Preservation**: Exploring how AI can be used to preserve and promote indigenous languages and traditions.\\n\\n1. **Economic Implications**: Assessing how AI might affect indigenous economies and job markets.\\n\\n1. **Legal and Regulatory Landscape**: Understanding the evolving legal framework surrounding AI and its implications for indigenous rights.\\n\\n1. **Technical Foundations**: Grasping the basic principles of how AI systems work, including their limitations and potential.\\n\\n1. **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential risks of AI adoption and strategies for mitigation.\\n\\n1. **Opportunities for Innovation**: Recognising how AI can be leveraged to address unique indigenous challenges and opportunities.\\n\\nIndigenous tech leaders need to develop a nuanced understanding of AI\'s pros and cons, risks and opportunities, capabilities and limitations. This comprehensive knowledge is crucial for making informed decisions about AI adoption and development that align with indigenous values and interests.\\n\\nWithout this level of AI literacy, we\'re risking a lot.\\n\\nShare## What\'s at Stake Here for Indigenous?\\n\\nThe impact of AI development and adoption for indigenous communities presents both massive opportunity and serious potential harms.\\n\\nUninformed or misinformed decision-making by tech leaders lacking a comprehensive understanding of AI\'s capabilities and limitations could lead to misguided strategies or implementations that fail to serve or even harm indigenous interests. This knowledge gap increases the risk of indigenous communities being left behind in the AI revolution or, worse, becoming unwitting fodder in systems that may exploit or misrepresent their cultural heritage.\\n\\nParticularly concerning is the potential misuse or mishandling of indigenous knowledge within AI systems. Large language models, trained on massive amounts of internet data, may inadvertently incorporate sacred or sensitive indigenous information without proper context, consent, or respect for cultural protocols.\\n\\nThis could lead to the inappropriate dissemination of protected knowledge, cultural appropriation on a grand scale, or the distortion of traditional wisdom when filtered through AI algorithms.\\n\\nWithout informed leadership and careful oversight, AI technology inadvertently becomes a tool that perpetuates historical patterns of exploitation and marginalisation, rather than empowering indigenous communities in the digital age.\\n\\nWhen indigenous folks only know about \\"Data Sovereignty\\" as the risk with LLMs, that potentially means that person doesn\'t understand LLMs and the AI topic well enough.\\n\\nWhat are the risks and concerns that are already known about LLMs?\\n\\n## AI Ethical Concerns\\n\\nI was actually in the middle of researching the positive and negative effects of relying on AI for research and learning when I read the LinkedIn post that this post drew inspiration from.\\n\\nThe paper I was reading,\\"The effects of over-reliance on AI dialogue systems on students\' cognitive abilities: a systematic review\\", had this brilliantly summarised list of ethical concerns with respect to AI.\\n\\nThe key points are:\\n\\n- **AI hallucinations**: Generation of inaccurate or misleading information\\n\\n- **Algorithmic biases**: Potential to perpetuate or amplify existing societal prejudices\\n\\n- **Plagiarism**: Reproduction of content without proper attribution\\n\\n- **Privacy concerns**: Issues related to accessing and processing vast amounts of personal data\\n\\n- **Transparency issues**: Lack of clarity in AI decision-making processes\\n\\n- **Ethical implications**: Need for responsible development and deployment of AI technologies\\n\\nThese points represent widely known AI ethical risks that any tech leader, including those in indigenous communities, should be familiar with to make informed decisions about AI adoption and development.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, the intersection of AI and indigenous knowledge presents both unprecedented opportunities and serious challenges.\\n\\nThe apparent lack of comprehensive AI literacy among some indigenous tech leaders is concerning and needs urgent attention. This knowledge gap, in my humble opinion, exposes communities and indigenous knowledge to massive risk of exploitation and misrepresentation.\\n\\nMoving forward, it is super critical that indigenous tech leaders prioritise developing a nuanced understanding of AI technologies, their implications, and ethical considerations. This goes beyond surface-level knowledge of AI applications to gain a deep grasp of AI\'s potential impacts on everything to do with culture, data sovereignty, and community well-being.\\n\\nUltimately, the goal should be to empower indigenous tech leaders to become not hacks or basic implementers of AI, but informed, critical, and innovative players in the global AI landscape.\\n\\nAnd you can\'t do that by learning AI basics from a Netflix documentary.\\n\\nThanks for reading, see you in the next one.\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"there-no-pasifika-in-tech-problem","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/there-no-pasifika-in-tech-problem","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-08-20 - There-is-no-Pasifika-in-Tech-Problem.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-20 - There-is-no-Pasifika-in-Tech-Problem.md","title":"There is no \\"Pasifika in Tech\\" Problem","description":"Reframes Pasifika tech issue arguing problem is not low representation but manufactured false demand by nonprofits and corporations.

What is the problem? Who is the problem for?\\"*\\n\\nThis was a question I asked on theTechNesian Live Stream, and it\'s one I\'ve been asking myself recently, especially in light of thePasifika Tech Network shutdown.\\n\\nBack in 2021, I would have said \\"yes,\\" but my answer today would be \\"No, we don\'t have a Pasifika in tech problem.\\"\\n\\n*Why is that?*\\n\\nBecause*\\"low numbers of Pasifika in tech\\"*is not the same as*\\"there are barriers and no support for getting more Pasifika in tech.\\"*\\n\\nOne of these is a Pasifika problem, the other is just an objective statistic in the tech industry.\\n\\nWe got it wrong somewhere way back at the start.\\n\\n## Manufacturing Demand\\n\\nFrom about 2020 onwards, possibly amplified by the realities shown to us by the pandemic, there was a sudden narrative for getting more Pasifika into technology careers. We needed to help our community out of these jobs that saw them out delivering things in the middle of a pandemic because they had no choice.\\n\\nThe tech industry was going to be the choice that saved them.\\n\\nI started seeing interviews and newspaper articles crop up. Established organisations were pumping out the Pasifika marketing for grad roles and being a great place to work for Pasifika. New organisations were popping up, marketing the Pasifika angle hard; imagery and themes on websites for these education providers and workplaces were exploding at this time.\\n\\nThe community was putting on Talanoa and evenings to talk about getting Pasifika into tech and how they were doing that[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\nI attended a few, and they were all well-attended.\\n\\nI remember going to a \\"Tech Talanoa\\" out South Auckland once that had four panelists \\"working in tech,\\" none of whom were engineers[2](#footnote-2). One Pasifika father got so frustrated at one point from not hearing anything related to the technical side of the industry that he grabbed the microphone and, with broken English, told the panel that he brought his 16-year-old son there to hear about \\"the programming,\\" and he hasn\'t heard anything yet.\\n\\nI feel like these talks just bamboozled our community.\\n\\nThey gas-lit them into thinking:\\n\\na) \\"Oh, you don\'t have to like tech, just come and bring your vibes,\\"\\n\\nand/or\\n\\nb) \\"Hey, the technical side is hard; maybe just do your customer service role like a good \'soft skills worker.\'\\"\\n\\nI don\'t feel like these events did a great service to the community\u2014 too many times it was \\"come to tech on vibes and Pasifika-ness\\".\\n\\nDon\'t get me wrong, I think there\'s a lot of value in indigenous knowledge and wisdom- but the key to the door the community was knocking on was a change in their economic situation, not a pep-talk for revolutionising a system that\'s got a long way to go before it puts profit aside for indigenous brownie points.\\n\\nBut I digress...\\n\\nHow could we*not*think \\"yo, there\'s crazy demand by Pasifika for getting into tech, where do we start solving for this?\\"\\n\\n## Rethinking the Problem Definition\\n\\nWhen we all started trying to help get more \\"Pasifika into Tech,\\" did we stop and ask a crucially important question\u2014do Pasifika*want*to get into Tech?\\n\\nI saw an example just this week of framing a problem in a way that may make an assumption that leads to the wrong pathway being taken, similar to how I feel the \\"Pasifika in tech\\" pathway was misunderstood.\\n\\nThis statement from a fairly prominent M\u0101ori scholar, who said:\\n\\n*\\"We need to ensure we create pathways for education in IT and in particular computer science, machine learning and all areas of AI. There are many reasons why, statistically, M\u0101ori make up about 5% of the tech industry and 0.16% of the AI workforce.****We just need to work on removing those barriers and making clear pathways****.\\"*\\n\\nThat last line, in bold.\\n\\nThis perspective underscores a critical need to differentiate between actual barriers\u2014such as lack of access or education\u2014and just a lack of interest in pursuing careers in these fields.\\n\\nI\'m not sure about everyone else, but when I noticed the lack of Pasifika in tech while contracting in the industry back in 2016, my next step was to ask \\"why?\\" The answers I found online were that it was a*\\"pipeline problem,\\"*i.e., Pasifika weren\'t being exposed to these options early in their school life, so they weren\'t picking it up at the tertiary or work end of things.\\n\\nThat\'s fair.\\n\\nThat\'s a long-tail investment that looks like code clubs for 8-12 year old Pasifika kids, exposing them to the tech option, and hoping that seed planted grows into a choice when they\'re looking at what to study at university.\\n\\nProblem solved, case closed.\\n\\nWhat about the Pasifika of working age now or in years 11, 12, and 13 of high school who need to make some choices soon?\\n\\nIf the \u201cproblem\u201d definition is that Pasifika are in sun-setting industries, Pasifika are in mostly low-paid work, and Pasifika are underrepresented in the tech field (i.e., the field that\u2019s going to determine a lot of the future workforce and decision-making, such as bias in tech design, AI, etc.), then yes, we have a***\u201cPasifika have a problem that getting into tech will help solve\u201d***problem.\\n\\nThese are***economic***problems.\\n\\nA tech career is not the only solution to this, any high paying job will help solve for this.\\n\\n*Why is this important?*\\n\\nBecause then your audience, motivations and strategies are completely different- you now have someone who just wants to get in a better financial position, whether that\'s tech, real estate or multi-level marketing.\\n\\n## The Challenge of Assisting the Uninterested\\n\\nThis makes for a really different problem to solve, i.e., helping someone who knows they want to get into tech and you\u2019re in a position to help them is relatively straightforward. Helping someone who doesn\u2019t know what they want (tech) or wants something you can\u2019t give them (carrying them into tech) is a waste of everyone\u2019s time.\\n\\nThis would be my experience going into the community over the past several years, talking about tech careers, showing up to panels and doing the same- advocating for more Pasifika into tech. I worked with Samoan churches to deliver free, weekly coding & technology sessions; and in each iteration of the community programme, even after a strong start, the interest and attendance would wane and decline to a point where it was not worth the effort by myself and my team to continue.\\n\\nI truly believed the demand problem was because we \\"didn\'t know about tech careers\\", and solving that by taking the good word out into the community would be met with a fair share of the \\"great demand\\" there was for Pasifika wanting to get into tech, but just wasn\'t getting the support- the industry not meeting them where they were at.\\n\\nWell, me and my team did meet the community where they were at- in schools, in churches etc.\\n\\nAnyone can do a one-off big bang event and \\"do numbers\\" like a highlight reel.\\n\\nMe and my team weren\'t interested in that.\\n\\nWe were here for the long-term week in and week out support and building up of the community\'s tech exposure, knowledge and capabilities.\\n\\nAnd I feel like we did that, from 2017 with code clubs, taking a break during the pandemic, and coming back out into Pasifika churches and high schools when things opened up again.\\n\\nThe trouble with that is, it takes two to tango- and after getting \\"stood up\\" more than a few times on more than a few different initiatives, we have to read the feedback (at least for us) for what it is.\\n\\nAnd when I see full-time organisations, dialling back down on the Pasifika in tech rhetoric, pivoting away from the original mission statement, especially given the number of staff they have available, I know it\u2019s not just me.\\n\\nFor Pasifika, getting into tech is not \\"a problem\\", because it\'s not what they want, so not being in it, is not a problem.\\n\\n## Futility & An Inevitable Outcome\\n\\nIt took me way too long to accept that this was the case- there isn\'t a demand for Pasifika wanting to get into tech, that it wasn\'t a lack of knowledge i.e. even when they knew what was available, it just wasn\'t what a lot of Pasifika were interested in.\\n\\nI was convinced early on that Pasifika \u201cdon\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know,\u201d so I thought showing them the tech solution would be the thing to do. A lot of double talk and gestures without commitment helped confuse the reality, and it took too long for me to sort the signal from the bullshit\u2014that\u2019s on me, though.\\n\\nI never had a problem with Pasifika not being interested in tech, I\'ve said on every occasion, if this is you, great, if not, you\'ll find what you\'re into elsewhere, this isn\'t the be-all end-all for Pasifika futures- its just an option, for the geeks and the technically minded[3](#footnote-3).\\n\\nThe issue here is when the problem is misunderstood, then the solution and efforts to solve the problem are actually irrelevant, ineffective, and largely a waste of everyone\'s time.\\n\\nIt\'s only happened recently, but I\'ve started changing the way I engage with the \\"Pasifika in tech\\" landscape. It\'s not all the way \\"there\\" yet, but it\'s a work in progress.\\n\\nNowadays, I take a more \u201cpush\u201d than \u201cpull\u201d approach. To take a tech concept that is, I put a signal out into the community, a sign-up, a survey. If that activity gets numbers, my team and I build for those respondents. We try to address the need, within our objectives and skill-sets, where it\'s at.\\n\\nI set my expectation to low numbers and high quality, rather than filling seats with tyre kickers.\\n\\n## The Rise and Fall of \\"Pasifika in Tech\\" Initiatives\\n\\nIt\'s interesting to note where the industry is at this point in time.\\n\\nSince 2020, fast forward four years, and it\'s a lot quieter now on the socials, on the marketing, and the push for \\"Pasifika in tech\\" has all but vanished from the scene. Organisations that were championing the cause of getting more \\"Pasifika in tech\\" have long since pivoted to other underrepresented groups, or change the focus from helping Pasifika get into tech directly, to helping Pasifika feel more at home in their own skin, then somewhere along the lines this will help them get into tech[4](#footnote-4).\\n\\nIt\'s a new day, probably about time too- I know my draft of a piece titled*\\"Not Samoan enough for Samoans, and never going to be Palagi\\"*would be a good follow on from this discussion, but again, another story for another time.\\n\\nThanks for reading, more than happy to hear your thoughts on this? Do you agree? Disagree?\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"shutting-down-pasifika-tech-network","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/shutting-down-pasifika-tech-network","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-07-30 - Shutting-Down-the-Pasifika-Tech-Network.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-30 - Shutting-Down-the-Pasifika-Tech-Network.md","title":"Shutting Down the Pasifika Tech Network","description":"Post-mortem analysis of failed Pasifika Tech Network showing pipeline not engagement problem is actual barrier to community participation.

And why?*\\n\\nTo understand that, we have to go back to the beginning and look at why it was created in the first place; what its intended goal was; and the reasons it wasn\'t able to live up to this.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Genesis of the Network\\n\\nWhen I started on the \\"how do I get more Pasifika into tech?\\" journey back in 2016, my first stop was trying to identify Pasifika already in tech and creating a network so we could help each other into various roles in the industry.\\n\\nI started the LinkedIn group known today as \\"Pasifika in IT\\" (originally called the \\"Polynesian Tech Professionals\\"), to gather said professionals, and was dismayed that of the 300+ people who joined the group, only a handful were technical, and only 2 showed up to a meetup.\\n\\nDigging into the root of the problem, I discovered a*\\"pipeline issue\\"*.\\n\\nI started running code clubs in 2017, and in 2019 \\"The Pasifika Tech Education Charity\\" was born, delivering code clubs and workshops for Pasifika primary through high school students to cater to the \\"pipeline\\".\\n\\nThe goal was always to get a direct line from Pasifika people to tech work and careers. With limited time and resources, I figured a focus on cultivating a network of Pasifika professionals would:\\n\\n1. Develop and advance Pasifika tech workers careers\\n\\n1. Those advanced tech workers would feed back into the code club volunteering for the next generation.\\n\\nThe group was filled with sales people, marketers, recruiters, people managers and generally \\"rubber neckers\\". Trying to get engagement (I guess like most/all LinkedIn groups) was like pulling teeth, screaming into the void, or talking to a brick wall - you pick what euphemism works for you.\\n\\nBottom line, it was a group of spectators waiting for the show to start.\\n\\nI eventually found two engineers who joined the group, brothers, who were actually technical and were the target demographic for this group (shout out to the Sauni brothers). Before the group became a complete ghost town, we enjoyed a couple of meetups where we had coffee, traded career stories, and ate cake.\\n\\nAs I redirected my time and effort to my kids\' code club programme in the community, I eventually handed the group over to a good friend Steven Paea, and stood down from any and all Pasifika in IT things.\\n\\n## 2021 Post-Covid: A New Hope\\n\\nFast forward to 2021, the world as we knew it was forever changed by the pandemic.\\n\\nEveryone had finally experienced and seen with their own eyes, the disparity between communities and groups of people in terms of wealth, opportunities and real-life realities. Coming out of the lock-downs and the country really coming to grips with how fragile and unequal our society was, it felt like there was a new-found hope, and drive to get the \\"have nots\\" i.e. communities like Pasifika, the hell out of the enduring poverty-riddled situation it\'s always been in.\\n\\nThis was the new hope that had me hoping for maybe a new result to an old play - can I start up another Pasifika Network?\\n\\nWell, I did.\\n\\nAnd it was called \\"The Pasifika Tech Network\\" aka PTN... and it was pretty good at the start...\\n\\nTo be fair, it was more organised this time. It had a proper registration form, a mailing list system, a Discord server; we eventually had a newsletter, a website and a GitHub account.\\n\\nI\'m a 24/7 geek, so being pathologically online and around to cultivate and grow the online community aspect of our network wasn\'t anything out of the ordinary for me. I was online, starting conversations, sharing information, organising the server with new features, bots (with the help of Luka Tauvae), and taking feedback from members to create channels and events to support our mission.\\n\\n## The Pasifika Tech Network in Action\\n\\nThe PTN was starting to pick up steam.\\n\\nWe had even formed a \\"committee\\" with a group of committed members, to meet once a month to discuss and plan things to make the server, and the network what we wanted it to be.\\n\\nOver the next couple of years, the PTN ran regular online study sessions (complete with study bots, with timers, awards and task tracking), we had online meetups to catch-up with people who were around; we had several in-person meetups for both technical & professional presentations, as well as just social gatherings for a drink, cake and even board games.\\n\\nWe ran a discussion forum on the Discord that went deep into members experiences, good and bad as well as things like salaries, racism and workplace bullying. We even had a health-and-wellbeing channel where everyone posted their workout goals, or just encouragement for staying physical given our industry is pretty sedentary.\\n\\nOur careers channel posted job descriptions of roles going at members workplaces, and I\'m happy to say more than a few members landed roles successfully through the network.\\n\\nIn an effort to try to recruit more members to active roles within the network, helping with the mission of \\"getting more Pasifika into tech\\", we setup a Volunteering system where members could pick the activity they wanted to volunteer on - events, writing the monthly newsletter, being a volunteer with my charity (PTEC), promo team.\\n\\nThere were so many comments and sentiments to the effect of \\"grateful for this space, there\'s nothing like it\\". I even put it to the discussion forum once, during one of many \\"quiet\\" periods in the network, whether we should open up to non-Pasifika to join as well?\\n\\nI got a resounding \\"no, this is our space, we can let our guard down here like we can\'t anywhere else\\".\\n\\nVerbally, and occasionally in-person, there was a lot of consensus that this was an important and needed space.\\n\\nSo, why did it go the way it went after all this?\\n\\n## The Signs and Reality\\n\\nWhen the activities online required constant initiation by the same people every time, fewer people would be \\"online\\" and contribute to the chat, it definitely felt like the momentum and interest was waning. Surveys to better understand what could make the network more valuable, emailed to members got little to no responses. Even the volunteering channels with people joining activities as low-maintenance as the promo team i.e. the \\"write something about the network on your social media\\" activities team got zero posts out.\\n\\nThat\'s not to say no one did anything, a couple of people really came through with their time and efforts - Luka with the discord admin, GT with the Study sessions and Charity, TJ with the newsletter - but the general consensus kept pointing out that I may be barking up the wrong tree.\\n\\nWas there really a demand for Pasifika badly wanting to get into tech, where they were crying out for a network like this to help get them there?\\n\\nThe reality of the demographic in the PTN wasn\'t the cliche poverty-stricken Pasifika, but that\'s not to say they weren\'t without their challenges. The folks the network was fostering were those who were already in tech, they\'d done the hard work or caught the break already in their niche interest, and gotten into tech.\\n\\nThey had their own places, even if renting, they were on better salaries, and weren\'t struggling in the same way their parents were/did. Yes, still very much involved in family and community, so time, space and money is shared.\\n\\nMembers had young families, trying to live and survive in Auckland, some even moving out of Auckland for that reason. A lot of folks were still in the junior end of their careers, so they were in a building phase, which I know from experience, takes time and energy. You don\'t have the flexibility of a more seasoned tech worker, or the opportunities that allow for it.\\n\\nYou also don\'t have the knowledge, or experience to roadmap your way there, so you\'re stuck in this stage for longer if not indefinitely.\\n\\nI would think this is exactly why Pasifika, in tech, would lean into a network like the one I was trying to build; because it would expedite the process of advancing themselves to a place with less stress and more resources, provide community where our people were scarce, and to be able to stand on the few shoulders of people available to support and bridge this gap.\\n\\nI was wrong.\\n\\n## Lessons Learned\\n\\nI was raised by my mum to always look at myself and my actions first\u2014the \\"log out of your own eye\\" before the speck of dust in someone else\'s, so to speak.\\n\\nSo here are some things I\'ve thought about that were in my control and contributed to the PTN not working out.\\n\\n### Underestimated the Work Required\\n\\nTo an extent, I had expectations that I would invest x amount of effort that would be picked up at point \'y\'\u2014you know, like a mathematical equation. If I had the right parameters and got the graph trending to the required threshold, nature would take over and it would organically grow on its own. It didn\'t, so I might have underestimated where that line was and subsequently never reached it. This would explain why I had to keep investing x amount of effort over the lifetime of the PTN without it ever taking off.\\n\\nMaybe I was aware that more of me was required to take it further and find that threshold, but that\'s something I\'ve been aware of doing this work.\\n\\nI have a finite amount of time, effort, and fucks to give about any one thing in my life, and I knew that I would give what I had to for this, and no more.\\n\\nIf what I had to give, was less than what was required, and no-one else could make up the short-fall, this was always going to be the natural conclusion.\\n\\n### Misunderstood the Demographic\\n\\nThis is another reason I think it didn\'t work out.\\n\\nI didn\'t understand the demographic I was targeting. I thought I did; I thought I knew their motivations, drive, and intrinsic values. Even when surveying and parsing that data, I thought I had things on track. But the proof was in the pudding\u2014whatever I was doing was not the \\"thing\\" that was going to get the result I was after from this group.\\n\\nMaybe they just wanted to hang out occasionally, leave their careers in the 9-5 slot, and just be part of something in the background.\\n\\nFunnily enough, I sent out a post-closedown survey to get feedback on how people felt about the network and what did and didn\'t work. Surprisingly, I got a few responses saying they wished they had participated more, that they were just happy something like the PTN existed and they could join in whenever they wanted to.\\n\\nWhat kind of member is that?!\\n\\nWhat kind of member is happy for something to exist that they can benefit from when they feel like participating, and were then sad to see it go?\\n\\nI know this and the \\"just hang out\\" demographic was not my intended audience, and misunderstanding what I was working with is on me.\\n\\n### Not the Right Person\\n\\nAt the risk of sounding like a self-fulfilling prophecy, one takeaway I have to consider\u2014or know is a possibility\u2014is that I wasn\'t the right person for this work.\\n\\nAll things being equal, let\'s say the work was roughly what I thought it would be, time and energy investment-wise, and the demographic was keen, driven, and ambitious Pasifika engineers looking for a place to belong to, contribute, and grow\u2014was I the right person to lead and do this work of starting and growing the network?\\n\\nI would say yes. Under these circumstances, I think I would be.\\n\\nBut circumstances outside of this? i.e., circumstances as they turned out to be, could have benefited from someone with different skills. Someone who could have inspired this demographic from where they were to where they needed to be for this vision to succeed.\\n\\nThis, I think, is my shortcoming, my failure. I wasn\'t the right person for solving this problem.\\n\\nI\'m the person who can take a junior engineer and show them the way to senior, and play the corporate tech industry game.\\n\\nI\'m just not the person to make you *want* that for yourself.\\n\\n### Know When to Fold \u2018Em\\n\\nI maybe made a few \\"new venture\\" mistakes here, as you can tell already by \\"not knowing the demographic,\\" i.e., my market or \\"customers\\". I didn\'t do enough to validate my thesis that this was something people wanted. I assumed, based on what I thought would be valuable and what has been a valuable experience for me in my professional network, that it would be valuable for my Pasifika tech community too.\\n\\nFailing this, and continuing with the thesis long after the signals were there that this wasn\'t the case, I could have probably wound it up sooner and saved some time and energy.\\n\\nThat\'s on me.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nWhere to from here?\\n\\nI\'d be lying if I said this wasn\'t disheartening. As much as I know I\'m no one\'s saviour, it sucks to put energy into something that doesn\'t pan out. When it\'s something like work and career, that\'s one level of sucking. When it\'s a plan you think could have far-reaching benefits for your community and this was just the first step, it\'s even harder.\\n\\nFor me, I still have a charity that has been going for 5-6 years now, with Pasifika volunteers that fit the description of the demographic I was targeting with the PTN. I think I got it right in this case because we are going strong, with outcomes and activities in the community to validate that claim.\\n\\nI think, going forward, I\'m going to validate and prioritise what I\'m going to dedicate time and energy to more ruthlessly. I think it\'s best not only for myself but for all the other things in my life that require time and energy\u2014it would be unfair to spend it unwisely again.\\n\\nIf it doesn\'t come across that way, let me say it here\u2014I don\'t say all this to suggest anyone owes me anything; they don\'t. My hope was always that Pasifika would have seen the value in this thing and worked with me on it towards an outcome for our community.\\n\\nI know there are even more organisations out there now, helping Pasifika towards tech pathways, and that\'s great. I just know there was nothing quite like what we had with the Pasifika Tech Network.\\n\\nOnto the next one.\\n\\nThanks for reading,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"checking-in","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/checking-in","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-07-26 - Checking-in.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-26 - Checking-in.md","title":"Checking in...","description":"Brief check-in thanking paid subscribers and teasing upcoming podcast format for newsletter content.

The layout, design, and production quality in the lighting, sound, and visuals were on par with some of the best events I\u2019ve been to, including the NZ Music Awards, Rhythm & Vines main stages, NZ Homegrown, and shows at Vector Arena[2](#footnote-2).\\n\\nAll, I imagine, on a budget much lower than those events.\\n\\nThis, in my opinion, is the true sign of excellence\u2014making the most of what you have. This has been a feature of the M\u0101ori people as I\u2019ve known them my whole life. Don\u2019t let the news channels and newspapers\' anti-M\u0101ori propaganda fool you into believing the usual rubbish about any brown community. Once you actually look into and experience people for yourself, you\u2019ll quickly see the truth.\\n\\nM\u0101ori are rich in history, culture, empathy, and humanity for everyone in NZ and around the world. Yes, they\u2019re \u201cpeople\u201d, and people are complex. You\u2019ll have those who aren\u2019t happy about one issue or disagree on outcomes and decisions about other things.\\n\\nThis is called the human condition and is not unique to M\u0101ori or their community. All human communities will have their positives and their negatives\u2014or \u201croom for improvements\u201d.\\n\\nI\u2019m often surprised, as an adult, that this has to be stated so often, so loudly, and so widely. I knew this as a kid; everything had \u201cpros and cons\u201d, \u201cups and downs\u201d, \u201cswings and roundabouts\u201d. It was so obvious as a kid that life and everything in it was \u201cyin and yang\u201d. So why, as adults, has it become so complicated?\\n\\nWhy is it suddenly not a \u201cspectrum\u201d and it\u2019s all black and white?\\n\\nSure, Israel and the genocidal Zionists have murdered 16,000 Palestinian children. Something like that is clearly black and white to me, as in capital \u2018W\u2019, wrong.\\n\\nBut I digress. Why am I recounting my experience at the M\u0101ori Tech Awards?\\n\\nI guess, mainly to document and share my thoughts as a Pasifika person living in NZ, watching a M\u0101ori event.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## M\u0101ori (Tech) Leadership\\n\\nI sat at the table with AWS (they are a sponsor of the awards, so I was there on the corporate ticket), alongside a fellow Pasifika Amazonian. That night I saw many established M\u0101ori organisations, with senior people at the helm. Sure, there are plenty of young ones doing awesome work, but the depth of leadership in the M\u0101ori community, all standing up and being counted, working together visibly, and supporting each other was something that stood out for me.\\n\\nIt stood out because of the contrast, in my opinion, to the Pasifika tech scene.\\n\\nWhere is this unity?[3](#footnote-3)Where is this consolidating or co-ordination of effort towards the same goals? I\u2019ve seen a bunch of initiatives come and go. I know a few good ones set up out south doing good work[4](#footnote-4).\\n\\nI don\u2019t expect everyone to get along just because we\u2019re Pasifika. Lord knows there are people in the community I won\u2019t work with, and I\u2019m sure the same can be said for those who wouldn\u2019t work with me.\\n\\nBut at some level, I was expecting some kind of leadership on this front.\\n\\nMaybe it\u2019s early days, and it\u2019s only a matter of time.\\n\\nAfter all, I believe Te Hapori Matihiko was, among other things, a response to theNZTechAlliance\u2014NZTech basically being the amalgamation of the entire NZ tech ecosystem. So, if it took that long to get there for Tangata Whenua (people of the land), I should probably manage my expectations about Pasifika getting organised, working together, and showing their excellence.\\n\\nAnd I don\u2019t mean individual Pasifika organisations showing Pasifika excellence by the number of their individual accomplishments they put on display. I mean organisations like Te Hapori Matihiko and events like their awards that show the \u201cunity\u201d and \u201cworking together\u201d at the centre of the display.\\n\\nThere was a certain \u201c*we can do it\u201d*emphasis there that night that I saw, which is very different from*\u201clook at me/us\u201d*, because it centred M\u0101ori and Te ao M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori world), which I thought was quite special.\\n\\n*So, is this something Pasifika should aspire to, and should we be building things right alongside M\u0101ori here in NZ?*\\n\\nAn answer both myself and my Pasifika colleague actually agreed on that night, as we discussed this at our table, was\u2014\u201cwe can\u2019t\u201d.\\n\\n*Why not?*\\n\\nBecause we\u2019re visitors.\\n\\nI\u2019ll explain.\\n\\n## Pasifika are \u2018Tangata Tiriti\u2019\\n\\nWhen it comes to Aotearoa (New Zealand), there\u2019s \u2018Tangata Whenua\u2019 (people of the land, indigenous) and \u2018Tangata Tiriti\u2019 (people of the treaty). Pasifika, for all the shared genealogy and whakapapa and all that, across the Oceans, are Tangata Tiriti.\\n\\nThey have to be.\\n\\nThis is*M\u0101ori*land[5](#footnote-5). I\u2019m not confused about that, that\u2019s set in stone for me.\\n\\nWe (Pasifika) are here on our cuzzies\u2019 and wh\u0101nau\u2019s land, under the blessing of Te Tiriti, doing our thing, thriving and surviving.\\n\\nBet.\\n\\nBut this is also why, in my mind, we can\u2019t build the same things in the same way. As much as we share similar cultural norms, traditions, and values as cuzzies, the structure of my culture, similar to M\u0101ori, is mapped across villages, titles, and families in Samoa.\\n\\nOur norms and traditions flow seamlessly and unobstructed back in the islands but are clunky, foreign, and \u201cfrictional\u201d here in Aotearoa, plonked on top of, or around a colonised society.\\n\\nA colonised society that sits \u201con top of\u201d an indigenous culture that refuses to be silenced or sidelined. That hikoi\u2019s, protests, and gathers to move against the forces that try to subjugate it.\\n\\nDo we, Pasifika, try to build our own villages here, alongside M\u0101ori? Or do we build our \u201climited liability\u201d companies alongside P\u0101keh\u0101 instead?\\n\\nObviously, \u2018work*with*M\u0101ori\u2019 is an option, but that\u2019s a very different thing to having \u201cyour own village\u201d, which would be comparable to what we have back on the islands. Which is why that\u2019s one of the options\u2014that\u2019s not really an option, so building something within the colonised paradigm it essentially*is*.\\n\\nI\u2019ve only ever known the P\u0101keh\u0101 world here in Aotearoa as a Pasifika person, playing their game and coming up in the world of technology. The only thing I was ever going to build here, in my mind, was my own career or a tech company. In both, I was essentially missing a direct \u201ccultural\u201d link or relationship[6](#footnote-6).\\n\\nSo, I\u2019m usually left with this\u2014build something, not unlike home in the islands, and not quite like P\u0101keh\u0101 \u2018New Zealand\u2019, and with respect to Tangata Whenua.\\n\\nWhat is that, and what does it look like?\\n\\nWhat does it even feel like?\\n\\nI don\u2019t know.\\n\\nI don\u2019t have the answer. In fact, I don\u2019t have many answers other than what I\u2019m doing for me and mine right now.\\n\\nAnd an answer I do have, which in my opinion, while bringing together a \u201ccultural link\u201d and building within the paradigm of our \u201cside\u201d of Tangata Tiriti, is sort of a \u201cmeh\u201d answer to this discussion[7](#footnote-7)\u2026\\n\\nis\u2026\\n\\nA registered NZ Charity, to help Pasifika learn about and get into the Tech industry.\\n\\n## A NZ Charity for Pasifika\\n\\nThe\u201cPasifika Tech Education Charity\u201dwas registered in 2019. After a few years of running code clubs myself in local primary schools, a few volunteers and I banded together to make a charity and continue our work under its banner and official mission.\\n\\nThe charity has the structure, legal recognition, and benefits given to any organisation complying with the laws of New Zealand. Its stated mission is to help Pasifika; by Pasifika for Pasifika etc. You know the drill.\\n\\nThat\u2019s it.\\n\\nThat\u2019s the best answer I have for what and how we build, as Pasifika, here in someone else\u2019s country. That is, something that abides by the law of the country, addresses the needs of Pasifika, and makes no claim to land, culture, or identity other than that stipulated by the people of the land.\\n\\nAnd no, I don\u2019t consider myself a foreigner. I was born and mostly raised in Aotearoa, and I\u2019m proud of this country. I see all Kiwis as my countrymen.[8](#footnote-8)\\n\\nThe whole topic of this essay, is just something I grapple with when thinking of my, and Pasifika\u2019s, place here, sort of between indigenous and Crown.\\n\\n## In Conclusion\u2026\\n\\nYou\u2019ll forgive me if you\u2019ve read this far and are possibly more confused now than you were at the beginning.\\n\\nBut I promise you, if you are, we are now in the same boat and on the same page as each other, so welcome.\\n\\nNg\u0101 Tohu Matihiko Awards night was amazing. It was beautiful to see M\u0101ori excellence that night, as I knew it to be, truly excellent!\\n\\nAnd it was a chance to reflect, think these thoughts, and write them out to share with you, dear reader. Maybe we\u2019ll talk about it online, over coffee, in an argument, or in flame wars on social media. The possibilities are truly endless!\\n\\nI joke, I joke. Let it be over coffee.\\n\\nBut I will sign off on an awesome whakatauk\u012b or \u201cM\u0101ori proverb\u201d from the awards night that resonated with me:\\n\\nThanks for reading, see you in the next one.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"layers-of-existence","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/layers-of-existence","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-06-09 - Layers-of-Existence.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-09 - Layers-of-Existence.md","title":"Layers of Existence","description":"Personal update exploring purpose in writing reflecting on world pain influencing creative output and avoiding inauthentic work.

I started it on LinkedIn as well. I told myself I was going to do a post on my blog regularly, and share it like I do on LinkedIn, like I do today.\\n\\nLike all exciting new projects, they start with a hiss and a roar and they go for some time, even long enough to get some feedback on things. Inevitably \\"life happens\\" or so the saying goes, because I think that\'s just a convenient, non-looking-too-deeply way of letting something go that wasn\'t a failure of execution as it was a failure of heart.\\n\\n*What affects the heart?*\\n\\nFor me, it\'s everything horrible going on in the world, it\'s knowing too much about how things are, the \\"reality\\" of life, and having no way of alleviating that pain, other than trying to distract myself with work, new projects or something more isolating so the pain in my head stops flowing to my heart.\\n\\nWhen your heart\u2019s impacted, you just don\u2019t feel the same way about things after that.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Be, Yourself?\\n\\nThat\'s usually my problem right there.\\n\\nI know the world is messy, I know it\'s ugly, and it\'s not personal, it just \\"is\\", but I let it get to me.\\n\\nWhen my last project fell through, it wasn\'t because I realised I didn\'t like writing, or that I wasn\'t good at it, or didn\'t enjoy and gain from it. No, it was because I\'d started being influenced by the likes and the comments, and I stopped just writing what was in my head and became more aware of how I \\"should\\" write, instead of just writing.\\n\\nSure, spell check and proofread shit, but writing to impress people, or to keep them happy or comfortable reading what you write is infinitely more work, and so much less rewarding- and for what? So people can like the writing of someone you\'re trying to be i.e. not you?\\n\\nI\'m not saying that\'s where this newsletter is going, although I am not completely cured of lapses in willpower. These days when I sense I\'m \\"should\\" writing instead of just writing, I just stop writing.\\n\\nI have 30-40 pieces of writing in my drafts from this year alone that I haven\'t published because somewhere in the process of writing them, they started feeling like \\"should\\" writing.\\n\\nHow do I know it\'s \\"should\\" writing?\\n\\nFor one, because I remember how hard it was just trying to stay on topic, the style would swing wildly at times and whenever I would leave and came back to it, I ended up deleting a whole lot of it because it just didn\'t sound like me!\\n\\nWhat is the actual point of putting out anything if it\'s not \\"you\\"?! To have your facade praised or criticised?\\n\\nIf it were praised, I could never feel like it was*me*being recognised and if criticised, the benefit of that feedback would be pointless because that\'s not*really*how I feel or see that issue!\\n\\nThat\'s what\'s funny about my \\"real\\" writing- as much as I want to write something concise and well-researched, like an investigative journalist, I\'m more comfortable shooting from the hip and synthesising the knowledge and information that\'s floating around my short and long term memory banks.\\n\\nThis newsletter is actually meant to be an update\u2026\\n\\nA*\\"hello, I\'m still here just been really busy.\\"*\\n\\n\u201cWith what exactly?\u201d, you ask, and that would be a great question.\\n\\nWhat have I been busying myself with?\\n\\n## It\u2019s The Same Question, Every Year\\n\\nWithout having to write the equivalent of a short novel, detailing the minutiae of my life\'s events- the high level overview is:\\n\\nfull-time work that sees quite a bit of travel domestic and international, coursework and exams to sit for work, creating and running my charity\'s tech workshops, helping my retirement age parents with several important projects, trying to get back to regular gym andBJJtraining and scheduling quality time in with family, driving to stay in touch with good friends, seeing my therapist regularly, getting run-down[1](#footnote-1)sick a couple of times, all while taking my wife and 9 month old son along for the ride.\\n\\nI forgot to mention the side projects and extra curricular learning you see documented on my blog, or the Pasifika Tech Network that\'s dying a slow death and a YouTube channel, battling for its place in the schedule.\\n\\nWhy am I so busy[2](#footnote-2)?\\n\\nThat\'s a good question, because I can\'t think of a time when I*didn\'t*have \\"lots on dot com\\".\\n\\nI try to answer this question every year like clockwork, because just like how I\'m doing now, I will get to a point in my life\'s year[3](#footnote-3)where I\'ll wake up to my reality and ask myself this question:\\n\\n*What am I doing with my life?*\\n\\nBecause I\'ve been \\"busy\\" since my 20\u2019s and now in my 40\u2019s, I\'m still busy?\\n\\nWhat haven\'t I figured out?\\n\\nThis is some \u201chustling backwards\u201d shit!\\n\\n## So, Why So...Busy?\\n\\nSure, being busy is not in itself a bad thing, so let\'s move past that and ask \\"Why?\\"\u2026\\n\\nWhy not relax?\\n\\nWhy not hone it down to just a couple of things and focus on doing those really well?\\n\\nThat\'s a great idea!\\n\\nWhy didn\'t I think about that before? /s\\n\\nI started the things I started because I genuinely like doing them e.g. the newsletter[4](#footnote-4), the charity, the tech workshops, the YouTube channel, being married, having a kid. I mean, if anything was going to \\"go\\" it would probably be work- but here\'s the thing, I enjoy most aspects of my job and the opportunity for learning all the things I like in tech, are right there.\\n\\nPlus the money, people and perks are pretty good as well, I\u2019ll be honest.\\n\\nI think I\'m busy, and I\'m doing all the things because, yes I genuinely want these things in my life, but there\'s a deeper reason, probably one that\'s harder to admit, but has been there staring me in the face, each and every year I\'ve reached this point and asked this question of myself:\\n\\n**It\'s because I don\'t know what my purpose in life is.**\\n\\nSure, I\'m great at a lot of things, and not to brag[5](#footnote-5), but I (and my brothers) always have been. From music, to sport, to school, to making good impressions in society[6](#footnote-6), careers and community work, to finances and modest wealth.\\n\\nThese are great- but the question, for me, remains.\\n\\n*What is my purpose in life?*\\n\\nShare## The*## Purpose*## Meaning Of Life is Not 42\\n\\nI know we don\'t have to have a purpose in this life, depending on how you look at it, we\'re not special, some have even described ourselves as nothing more \\"advanced chimpanzees hurtling through space on a rock\\".\\n\\n*Does a chimpanzee need a purpose in life?*\\n\\nMaybe that\'s the human dilemma, smart enough to consider ourselves special enough to have a purpose, but too dumb to know what that is instinctively.\\n\\nJust to be clear, this isn\'t an essay on how I\'m finding life meaningless- life\'s full of meanings, there\'s meanings coming out of our ears.\\n\\nJust none of them are \\"my\\" meanings.\\n\\nWhich isn\'t wrong, or bad, it\'s neither here nor there- but it goes some way to tease out the reason for why my life is busy.\\n\\nAm I filling the void?\\n\\nMaybe.\\n\\nMaybe I\'m meant to be filling my dance card[7](#footnote-7)with projects and new people and new ideas, and failing projects and shiny new adventures, because I might find my purpose eventually so I might as well keep myself busy for now, right?\\n\\nOr I find out, right at the end, that I never had a purpose in life- at least then I know, I had some adventures and experiences, and maybe helped others in their purpose in life.\\n\\nI don\'t know if my busyness is a deflection of the existence of a void, or a symptom of an as-yet unseen and unrealised deeper issue, but what\'s great about writing is the processing of your thoughts, especially these obsessive ones like \\"what\'s my purpose in life?\\"...\\n\\nAll the while my little 9 month old bundle of absolute joy sleeps in the cot next to me..\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI\'m a world of thoughts, and ideas, and meanings and I know I\'m curious enough to pull on any thread to see where it goes, or what comes out.\\n\\nThe start of this piece, I was pushing back on external influences, of staying true to yourself.\\n\\nOn examining what that self was, I saw, again, the busyness that is me and has been for as long as I can remember.\\n\\nI list the contents of my life and lay them out as things in differences of degree, but same in kind. Only to realise, my son is definitely not a difference of degree, and is a different kind altogether.\\n\\nI\'ve been looking at my \\"self\\" all wrong, or at least in the same way this whole time that hasn\u2019t gotten me any further in answering the question- and that looking at him instead, is looking at myself but without the layers I\'ve accumulated over the years.\\n\\nWithout the judgement, mistrust and cynicism baked into my current existence.\\n\\nI don\'t judge him, mistrust his intentions or have grand expectations of him, I just want to see him happy- being whatever he wants to be.\\n\\nI should be so bold as to always remember, to look for and wish the same for myself.\\n\\nThanks for reading, see you in the next one.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon.\\n\\nThank you for reading The Uncommon Engineer.

The reality of democracy and Western civilisation is being shown for the lies and hypocrisy it truly is, and it seems to be getting worse by the day.\\n\\nThe recent student protests that kicked off at Columbia University quickly spread around the world. They are in support of a free Palestine and aim to stop the genocide in Gaza this week.\\n\\nThese events have filled my timeline and my conscience, so I felt compelled to write it out.\\n\\nI know I addressed the situation in Gaza in a few newsletters ago in:\\n\\nThe image of the West as the \\"shining light on the hill\\" started unraveling in a very public way since October the 7th.\\n\\nThis situation just reminds me this is not the first time Western civilisation has been shown to be the imperialist hegemony it really is.\\n\\nAs we saw with Iraq, Afghanistan, and countless wars, WikiLeaks and wiki pages later revealed U.S. and European war crimes and atrocities.\\n\\nUsually, this stuff gets hushed up.\\n\\nThe media are able to facilitate the laundering of Western-backed genocides while Western governments are being trigger-happy on putting sanctions on countries.\\n\\nThey influence other countries to do the same (or else), or they just straight up \u201cregime change\u201d these sovereign nations, to better pillage that country\'s resources.\\n\\nI don\'t know why, but it feels different this time - and not in a good way[1](#footnote-1)\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe it\'s because of phrases like\\"the first genocide where victims are broadcasting their own destruction in real-time.\\"that describe just how connected we are due to technology, and that we can now get the real, raw,*on-the-ground devastation*in real time.\\n\\nI don\'t want to vent (much) about geopolitics and history.\\n\\nI\'m not an expert in those fields. I know what I\'ve read and picked up, bits and pieces here and there.\\n\\nI wanted to look at how something can go from being a great idea - like liberty, freedom, and free speech - to something that\'s oppressive, tyrannical, and must be resisted.\\n\\nThat\'s essentially the first part of the opening quote - if you want bad things, want all you want, it\'s got nothing to do with me.\\n\\nBut, and it\'s a massive \\"but\\", if the person has the***\\"power\\"***to bring about those bad things, upon me - that is 100% every single part, my problem.\\n\\nIt\u2019s about power.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Powerful vs Everyone Else\\n\\nPower is a force that shapes our lives in countless ways, but also in ways that differ depending on who you are.\\n\\nFrom geopolitical conflicts to personal interactions with police - your relationship with power will either have you excusing a genocide or resisting an occupation, by any means necessary.\\n\\nWhile it\'s neither inherently good nor bad, how it\'s wielded determines its ethical impact and ultimate consequence.\\n\\nI\'ve experienced firsthand how power can be abused by those in authority.\\n\\nI got in trouble with the police in my younger days, fighting to protect my brother from a police officer\'s knee on his throat after he was wrongfully arrested and was actually handcuffed at the time.\\n\\nI remember reading the police report filled with some absolute lies.\\n\\nIt described me like some animal, who was belligerent and \\"grunting\\" (I shit you not), not the concerned brother who was calmly asking them why he was being arrested before the officer wanted to show me \\"who was in charge\\".\\n\\nThere\'s a reason I don\'t have any convictions despite my run-ins with the police.\\n\\nI had lawyers[2](#footnote-2).\\n\\nI had lawyers because I had some money.\\n\\nI had money because I had knowledge; knowledge that got me paid, and knowledge that said, this is how you fight back against a system that\'s open to corruption.\\n\\nThese experiences just reinforced what I already knew at the time, that knowledge is power.\\n\\n## The Movement\\n\\nI\'m currently seeing and watching all the news stories of the universities around the world protesting the genocide in Gaza by the apartheid state of Israel.\\n\\nI\'m seeing students putting their bodies on the line and resisting peacefully even though they are being assaulted by \u201ccosplay G.I. Joe\u201d police forces, and zionist supremacists who seem to have carte blanche when it comes to assault and battery of anyone they want.\\n\\nIt\'s actually been really surreal to see the treatment of students by their own government. They act in the exact same way they would lecture Egypt or Russia or other non-Western countries, somehow assuming a moral superiority for being the pillar of democracy - which we all know, and are seeing in real time, is an absolute farce.\\n\\nI\'m seeing the student protesters trained in talking with the media. Mainstream media who time and again show up in absolutely bad faith to try and \\"gotcha\\" these young people, but failing to do so.\\n\\nKnowledge.\\n\\nI\'m seeing demands for divestment and public pressure put on these university administrations by students who understand the political influence of these stories and remain steadfast in their protest. More news stories of universities meeting these demands, one by one and again adding more pressure on the genocidal state of Israel.\\n\\nKnowledge.\\n\\nI\'m reminded of the Hong Kong student protests of 2019, railing against the machine looking to change their way of life.They used their understanding of surveillance cameras and tear gas to neutralise and fight backagainst the police and the state descending upon them.\\n\\nKnowledge.\\n\\nI guess when I said \\"it feels different this time\\" and not in a good way, is because I don\'t think I\'ve seen the West i.e. Western countries like Israel, UK, Europe, and the U.S. so blatantly be complicit. Through their vetoes, their spokespeople, the televised news coverage or lack thereof, the newspapers with the blatant lies in the face of daily war crimes, the hugely underestimated figure of 40,000 Palestinians, 15,000 of them children is...\\n\\nthere are no words for it.\\n\\nThere are no words in the English language to really convey how sickeningly grotesque this combination of unrelenting visual evidence of human carnage, meeting disgustingly flagrant disregard for truth, human dignity, and life, by the so-called \\"civilised\\" Western world.\\n\\nI\'m cynical by nature, not very trusting of the systems and institutions (or people in general to be fair), but even I was quite surprised at how blatant it\'s all been in the last 7-8 months.\\n\\nI\'m going to put that aside, for now.\\n\\nI am encouraged by the stance of university students all over the world. I\'m encouraged by Jewish people who are standing for the human rights and dignity of Palestinian people and everyone else in the world who can call a genocide a genocide and stand for what is right.\\n\\nThroughout history, there are examples of groups of people, mainly in the \\"powerless\\" group, banding together, working out the system and then fighting back for fair and equitable treatment.\\n\\nMany of them had dogs and hoses set on them, many of them were driven from their villages, more were murdered, lynched, or denied medical help that would cost them their lives.\\n\\nEven though members of the resistance went through this, the movement carried on, and on, until there was freedom.\\n\\nIt might not have been clean, or pretty, most of the time it was ugly, but the genuine care and love you would see amongst the members of the downtrodden, for their fellow human being, is the very, very best of the human experience and more than any status, feelings and delusions of being \\"superior\\" to another group of people, or anyone for that matter.\\n\\nLong live the resistance.\\n\\n## A Side Note\\n\\nI\'ve been trying to write this piece for weeks now. I will get partway through it, go off on an absolute tear and the sheer state of the world, and it would devolve into almost nonsensical rantings. As well as being super busy with work, community projects, and Dad life, I felt like I just needed to get this one done and published. I will head back to my regular tech-based topics as that\'s still a very real focus of my brain anyway, but I will always have a heart for those suffering injustice so, from now, until that beautiful day, it\'s always-\\n\\nIa manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"a-samoan-hackers-manifesto","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/a-samoan-hackers-manifesto","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-04-16 - A-Samoan-Hackers-Manifesto.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-16 - A-Samoan-Hackers-Manifesto.md","title":"A Samoan Hackers Manifesto","description":"Personal manifesto connecting hacker ethos with Samoan identity and arguing technology is political tool for community liberation and resistance.

I learned several musical instruments and could sing, dance and entertain on demand[4](#footnote-4).\\n\\nI played for the church band and sang in the choir.\\n\\nI got along fine in these environments, and I don\'t have a problem with them. I just never really fit in and always felt at odds with everything.\\n\\nCall it puberty, or your typical teen angst and hormones making everything confusing.\\n\\nI\'m a NZ-born Samoan kid, living in rural South Canterbury, as the only Pasifika family in the town and school district. My dad\'s a minister of a religion I\'m not sure at 12 or 13 I believe in anymore, and I\'m playing the bilingual kid\'s persona successfully, but I don\u2019t have any idea who exactly I really am at the time.\\n\\nFast forward to getting hacked while on my Dad\'s computer, and the world changed for me.\\n\\nThe computer didn\u2019t care I was Pasifika.\\n\\nIt didn\u2019t care my parents were religious or that I couldn\u2019t afford my own computer.\\n\\nIt didn\u2019t care what school I went to, or what area I lived in, or how much money my parents made.\\n\\n*\\"Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it\'s because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn\'t like me... Or feels threatened by me.. Or thinks I\'m a smart ass.. Or doesn\'t like teaching and shouldn\'t be here\\"*\\n\\nThe \u201cscene\u201d online was an extension of how my computer treated me, on the basis of what I knew and what I could do with computers.\\n\\nIt was either 31337 or it was lame.\\n\\nBut it was never because my school shoes were from the warehouse, or my nose was bigger than the other kids.\\n\\n*\\"We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias\\"*\\n\\nFor all the confusion in my life and myself at the time, never feeling like I quite fit in anywhere, I think computers were a place I could go and just be me.\\n\\nThe computer never asked anything of me, didn\u2019t have any expectations that I was super skilled or useless at computers. It would let me be great when I got it right, or just didn\u2019t work when I couldn\u2019t.\\n\\nWhen I say it would let me be \u201cme\u201d, I still didn\u2019t know who I was then, and my computer wouldn\u2019t care\u2014I could just be.\\n\\nThat was pretty rare for me at that time, to have a space where I didn\u2019t have to live up to anything or anyone\u2019s expectations. The better I did at school, or music exams, or representative sports teams, or other expectations from church or the community because we were \u201csuch good boys,\u201d the more the expectations to be good or great, or to maintain, just kept coming.\\n\\nI tell myself it could always be worse\u2014a lot of people had much worse childhoods\u2014but I know better than to downplay my lived experience.\\n\\nIt wasn\u2019t the worst; it was just that *gestures at things I\u2019d written above*.\\n\\n*\u201cSo hacking and computers, gave you an outlet, and a space to just be. That\u2019 deep.\u201d - me interviewing myself.*\\n\\nFunnily enough, I realised it went even deeper than that.\\n\\n## Hack the Planet\\n\\nIn my Christian, Samoan world and in society in general, I was always aware that there were rules for some people, and not for others.\\n\\n**cough*Israel*cough**\\n\\nBased on no fault or credit to yourself, you could be born into advantage or disadvantage, and your lot in life would then be subject to those rules, and the work required to overcome them.\\n\\nJust take a look at what\'s happening in Gaza right now, and the UN\'s useless-ness to even get a ceasefire as the death toll of33,600 Palestinians, a heart-breaking70% of those killed are women and children, continues to rise.\\n\\nSure, it seems naive thinking about it now, but hacking, as an ideology for me, was about equity, empowering the powerless, and giving voice to the voiceless. We could bring information, knowledge, and hence power to the people through the digital world, making resources that were once exclusive to the Ivy Leagues, and the greatest minds available to the economically poorest peoples to enrich and uplift them.\\n\\nWhen hackers were breaking professional engineers\' software, and kids who hadn\u2019t even made it to university were finding their way around controls and power, that was the light-bulb moment for me\u2014that the power was and always is with the people, not the companies and not the government.\\n\\nThe hackers were like Robin Hood to me.\\n\\nMoney was nothing; it was all about the skills and the prestige of being knowledgeable and skillful\u2014and using those skills for good causes because it was the right thing to do.\\n\\n## When the Hackers Grow Up\u2026\\n\\nThe hacker\'s manifesto, to me, is the soul inside every Pasifika geek who didn\u2019t fit into the rugby or sporting and entertainment stereotype, no matter how much we had the attributes or looked the part.\\n\\nThe hacker culture and community were people who respected intelligence, curiosity, thinking outside the box, not conforming, being anti-authoritarian, and anti-establishment.\\n\\nAnd it wasn\'t with fancy gear or an Ivy League computer science education.\\n\\nIt was kids who were weird and most likely neurodivergent, who only needed a terminal on an old laptop to break into NASA or the FBI and run riot with something they\'d figured out from some manuals online.\\n\\nAs I grew older and explored more philosophies\u2014stoicism, anarchism, atheism, and a few others\u2014I\'ve started to see a lot more outside my traditional Christian worldviews. All these philosophies really enriched how I saw the world, people, events, and ideas.\\n\\nThe hacker mindset was really the one that broke me out of where I was and gave me permission to keep thinking outside the box I existed in. There were others like me who didn\'t want to follow these rules, who saw the same things in front of them but wanted to configure them in a way that was better\u2014for everyone\u2014not just themselves and their tribe.\\n\\nShare## Real World. Real Consequences.\\n\\nIt\'s funny; I\'m partway through George Orwell\'s*1984*, and I know in popular culture this is the reference for all things \\"waking up\\" to the authoritarian state and overreach, tyranny, and a dystopian future that\'s going to be doom and gloom for humanity.\\n\\nI saw the hacker\'s manifesto, and that kind of thinking, as the resistance to the*1984*future. That the O.G. hacker mentality and culture is the antidote to Orwell\'s dystopian future.\\n\\nWhile I know I romanticize the hell out of hackers, hacking, and hacker culture, I\'m definitely not deluded by the reality of the real-world consequences of hackers and hacking.\\n\\nA list of the LoD alumni, the Fraternal Order of the Legion of Doom, shows a majority of the members getting caught and charged with crimes. There are lots of FBI raids on hackers, Computer Misuse Acts and Bills being passed to stamp down on hackers, even hackers turningraton their community\u2014there\'s a very real side to thinking (and let\'s be honest, playing) outside the box.\\n\\nIn this world, we[5](#footnote-5)are still subject to the rules & laws of our society\u2014but that\'s what I take from the hacker\'s manifesto, that the hacker doesn\'t just enter the matrix to free themselves of their physical form but to also avail themselves of all mental, emotional, and spiritual constraints as well.\\n\\n## Final Words\\n\\nIn conclusion...\\n\\nI\'ll leave you with this\\n\\nThanks for reading, see you in the next one.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"mediocre-narcissist-s-guide-to-blaming-diversity-for","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mediocre-narcissist-s-guide-to-blaming-diversity-for","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-04-03 - The-Mediocre-Narcissists-Guide-to-Blaming-Diversity-for-Your-Own-Failings.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-03 - The-Mediocre-Narcissists-Guide-to-Blaming-Diversity-for-Your-Own-Failings.md","title":"The Mediocre Narcissist\u2019s Guide to Blaming Diversity for Your Own Failings","description":"Exposes anti-DEI arguments as privileged mediocrity blaming diversity programs rather than accepting personal professional inadequacy.

You show them some love and give them the support they need. This way, they can do their job as best they can and feel comfortable and confident going to work.\\"*\\n\\nSo, DEI, gets the thumbs up from Mark \u201cDallas Mavericks Owner\u201d Cuban.\\n\\nWhich makes me think - if this Billionaire gets it, and he\'s a businessman who loves capitalism, so he is definitely no left-leaning liberal shill.\\n\\nAnd he\'s saying it\'s good for Business\u2026\\n\\nIf Mark Cuban gets it, then why do a lot of people find it hard to park the few examples of badly implemented DEI programs in favour of the majority of great outcomes for the rest of the programme?\\n\\nRhetorical question.\\n\\nAsked and answered, because we all know why, and that shit is not only exhausting, it means we\'re not going by facts and statistics anymore, we\'re going by people\'s \\"feelings\\" - wasn\'t this what those folks most upset by DEI say we shouldn\'t do? Go with our feelings over facts?\\n\\nIn the podcast, Mark points out that a lot of folks who get let go were actually not good at their jobs - where have we heard this before?\\n\\nMediocre people who think they\'re great and refuse to accept the objective feedback that they really are not good at their jobs. You know these types of people; they blame everyone but themselves.\\n\\n*Diversity hires are under-qualified and taking jobs of much more qualified \\"people\\"!*\\n\\nFor the \\"facts, not feelings\\" crowd, let\'s do some quick research and find out what evidence there is to back all these DEI claims being made on social media.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What Does the Research Say?\\n\\nBefore we kick into the research, and as good of a job as Mark Cuban did in the podcast, let\'s just set the definition of DEI once and for all:\\n\\n- **Diversity**refers to the presence of differences within a given setting, such as race, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, etc.\\n\\n- **Equity**is about ensuring everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources, and that fairness is upheld.\\n\\n- **Inclusion**means that everyone feels valued, respected, and empowered to participate fully.\\n\\nNothing crazy, right?\\n\\nIt\'s not mind-blowingly \\"out there.\\"\\n\\nAs a lot of the social media and figures like Lex Fridman were the main antagonists for this discourse on DEI \\"obviously ruining America,\\" let\'s start with what\'s known by peer-reviewed research on the impact of DEI in the workplaces of the U.S. of A.\\n\\n### United States of America\\n\\nIn 2019, McKinsey & Company released their report*\\"Diversity wins: How inclusion matters,\\"*[3](#footnote-3)the third report in a series they did investigating the business case for diversity, following the previous reports released in 2015 and 2018.\\n\\nThe report found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on executive teams were 25% more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the fourth quartile. For ethnic and cultural diversity, top-quartile companies outperformed those in the fourth quartile by 36% in profitability!\\n\\nIn 2020, a Glassdoor Diversity and Inclusion Workplace Survey[4](#footnote-4)showed 76% of employees (3 in 4) reported a _\\"diverse workforce is an important factor when evaluating companies and job offers.\\"_\\n\\nThat same year, a 2020 study[5](#footnote-5)by The Wall Street Journal found diverse and inclusive cultures are six times more likely to be innovative and agile, eight times more likely to achieve better business outcomes, and twice as likely to meet or exceed financial targets.\\n\\nDoes that sound like the outcomes of an under-qualified workforce full of mediocre, low-skilled diversity hires?\\n\\nShareThe McKinsey and WSJ studies show the positive business results of a more diverse company, which makes the Glassdoor survey read a little differently, huh?\\n\\nLike, maybe if the majority of the workforce values diversity in where they work, companies might want to take these DEI efforts seriously? Maybe?\\n\\nThese studies provide concrete, data-driven evidence that DEI initiatives lead to positive business outcomes, not the downfall of American companies. For those who value facts over feelings, the research speaks for itself.\\n\\n### Too Early to Celebrate\\n\\nSo, far from \\"taking all the jobs\\" and flooding the workforce with under-qualified hires, DEI\'s not even making that much of a dent according to the statistics!\\n\\nA \u201cCenter for Talent Innovation\u201d report[6](#footnote-6)found that only 3.2% of executive and senior-level positions were held by Black professionals, 2% by Hispanic professionals, and 0.8% by Asian professionals. While a 2020 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that job applicants with distinctively Black names were called back at a rate of 10.1%, compared to 15.2% for those with distinctively white names.\\n\\nDo you want to know how long it would take to close the economic gender pay gap globally?\\n\\nA 2021 report by the World Economic Forum states that, at the current rate of progress, it will take another\u2026 wait for it\u2026\\n\\n***267.6 years!!!***\\n\\nThis is the U.S.\\n\\nAt this point, on balance, and backed by evidence (sure, research and stats are a tricky thing, nothing\'s 100% blah blah blah), I\'m going with a few conclusions:\\n\\n1. A lot of the social media outrage is mostly racism, plain and simple.\\n\\n1. Some of it is coming from mediocre narcissists getting rightfully fired from their jobs. They need to blame anything else for their failures, so they went with their tried & true scapegoat: \\"it was those darker shaded people taking my job.\\" Classic garden variety racism.\\n\\nExhausting really, to be honest.\\n\\n### New Zealand\\n\\nNot wanting to only look at other countries\' problems like we don\'t have our own, I also looked into what the available research had about our DEI status and how many under-qualified hires were flooding the workplaces via this loophole.\\n\\nGuess what I found?\\n\\nNot much.\\n\\nDiversity Works New Zealand put out anAotearoa State of Workplace Inclusion 2021 Report, which had these diversity gems of just how well Women, M\u0101ori, and Pasifika were doing:\\n\\n- Women were more likely to lose jobs during Covid, and faced difficulties balancing work and home responsibilities.\\n\\n- Women are underrepresented in leadership, especially in the private sector. The public sector made more progress on female leadership representation.\\n\\n- M\u0101ori and Pacific peoples faced higher unemployment and under-utilisation during Covid. Migrants also faced challenges.\\n\\n- M\u0101ori and Pacific workers have lower pay and seniority. The ethnic pay gap has not improved significantly in 10+ years.\\n\\n## But They Hire by DEI Quota!\\n\\nThey shouted.\\n\\nFirst of all, dumbass, it\'s illegal.\\n\\nAnd very much so in the United States.\\n\\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) states that*\\"unlawful practices under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act include [...] using quotas based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\\"*\\n\\nHowever, I did find a 2021 report by The New York Times that found many companies were setting specific diversity goals and tying executive compensation to meeting these targets.\\n\\nWhile these goals are not illegal quotas, critics argue that they can lead to reverse discrimination.\\n\\nWhat I will extend this argument, is the fact I believe DEI programs can be done poorly and outside of just the hiring practice of widening the scope of qualified candidates to non-traditional hiring areas, the rest of the internal programs for DEI, in my experience, are*shit*.\\n\\nDoes this mean we scrap the whole thing?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\n## Any Evidence to the Claims of Under Qualified?\\n\\nIt\'s shit like this by Elon Musk that brings out society\'s lowest forms of sycophants, cheering on some made-up bullshit[7](#footnote-7).\\n\\n*\\"The criticism came after Musk claimed in a series of posts on X that efforts to diversify workforces at those companies have made air travel less safe. He offered no evidence for the claim, and one of his replies directed attention to a post by someone else speculating about the IQ of Black airline employees.\u201d*\\n\\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/elon-musk-boeing-dei-diversity-x-posts-pilots-rcna133351\\n\\nThe bootlickers claims that pilots from \u201cblack universities\u201d had lower IQ scores were found to be completely unsubstantiated (i.e., full of shit or \\"made up\\"), but then again, simple minds think pilots\' IQ scores are what fly the plane.\\n\\nShareI digress, looking at how qualifications and not having them, have been taken advantage of, by DEI folks:\\n\\n### United States of America\\n\\nIn 2003, The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) conducted a field experiment[8](#footnote-8)to measure racial discrimination. Basically, they sent in resumes to jobs with fake names that were either very African American (Black), or very White sounding names. Their study showed that not only did the White sounding names get more callbacks than the black sounding names, by 50%, but to top it off, if the resume was higher quality for the White name, they got 30% more callbacks, but the same quality resume for the black sounding name didn\'t change at all.\\n\\nYou can read the report yourself for all the things they controlled for to reach these conclusions, i.e., this isn\'t just another big \\"coincidence\\" of a study.\\n\\nFinally, a study[9](#footnote-9)published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) that discusses the academic performance of underrepresented students in STEM fields titled \\"The Diversity\u2013Innovation Paradox in Science\\" found that underrepresented students, including racial and ethnic minorities, tend to innovate at higher rates than majority students.\\n\\nWe could go on, but let\'s have a look a little closer to home.\\n\\n### New Zealand\\n\\nMy Google and AI-assisted searches couldn\'t find any peer-reviewed studies done specifically covering if DEI hires were under-qualified.\\n\\nWhat I did find was a report titled\\"Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in the New Zealand Construction Sector\\"reviewing the state of DEI in the NZ construction sector.\\n\\nOne of the key takeaways I found in the report was that recruitment initiatives struggle to treat diversity through an equity lens rather than*\\"treating everyone the same\\"*.\\n\\nIf recruiters don\'t even understand the difference between \\"equitable\\" and \\"equal\\", you could see an argument for people getting hired just to \\"treat everyone the same\\".\\n\\nHere\'s the thing though, this is just proof that hiring folks may need to consult a dictionary more, and we\'re still scant on evidence that we\'re getting flooded with all these under-qualified, freeloading criminals getting employed over \\"everyday Kiwis\\".\\n\\nOh, my bad, I added the last part to bring it home what this is really about, because I\'ll be honest, I\'m over this, and I also know this was never, ever, ever about fairness, truth, wanting the best outcome for everyone, etc.\\n\\n## So what is this really about?\\n\\nWell, it\'s definitely not about \\"logic\\" or \\"evidence-based conclusions\\".\\n\\nIt would not matter if I had a PhD in Diversity Studies and published a world-renowned paper on the topic, because shit like this is never about facts.\\n\\nIt\'s about people\'s feeeeeeeelings.\\n\\nYes, the same people calling everyone snowflakes, triggered, and woke.\\n\\nIf you believe a group of people do not deserve to be anywhere near you, or have the same or better things than you, no matter how much evidence points to hard work, smarts, meritocracy, and all the other things you associate with you and your \\"group\'s\\" status in life - then we can just cut this whole conversation short and save both of us a lot of time.\\n\\nAnd sick as this might sound, I think I would respect a person a lot more if they could do some self-reflection and just say to me,\\n\\n*\\"Ron, I just don\'t believe you or your people, who come from a Pacific Island and didn\'t have a written tradition, could be as smart or as wealthy as me - also, God said you can\'t be, so you must have cheated the tests and stole all that money\\"*.\\n\\nbecause then at least I would know you have a severe mental illness and need empathy, treatment, and probably be kept away from infecting other people with that white supremacy mind virus.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, and vitriol aside-\\n\\nThe evidence clearly shows that DEI initiatives are not the boogeyman they\'re made out to be. They\'re not flooding the workforce with under-qualified diversity hires. If anything, they\'re barely making a dent in the systemic inequalities that have plagued our society for far too long.\\n\\nBelieve me, I\'m no shill for DEI programmes, I\'m not a fan of the programmes I\'ve seen in my career.\\n\\nBut it\'s a start. It\'s \\"something\\", for now.\\n\\nDEI needs to be implemented properly (no shit), with sincerity, respect, and a long-term commitment to systemic change, rather than being performative or tokenism.\\n\\nIf people were actually wanting to talk about DEI, why it exists, what they don\'t understand about it, how folks have seen it work, or not work - that would be great, let\'s discuss, let\'s have an actual talanoa (talk). It\'s the bullshit bad-faith arguments I see on social media, and I know I should be the \\"bigger person\\" and do myself a favour and just log off, but I had to vent.\\n\\nBut I\'ll leave you with this -\\n\\nto be successful, DEI initiatives**require**:\\n\\n- buy-in from leadership\\n\\n- ongoing education and training\\n\\n- a willingness to have difficult conversations\\n\\n- a willingness to challenge existing biases and power structures.\\n\\nIf your organisation strives to create this culture, not only can you improve the bottom line but also just make a better, more welcoming place for everyone[10](#footnote-10)to come and work at."},{"id":"technology-political-no-matter-how-much-people-try","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/technology-political-no-matter-how-much-people-try","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-03-23 - Technology-Is-Political-No-Matter-How-Much-People-Try-to-Say-Its-Not.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-23 - Technology-Is-Political-No-Matter-How-Much-People-Try-to-Say-Its-Not.md","title":"Technology Is Political.

Let Me Count The Ways\\n\\nIf you\'re already familiar with how terrible the world is in various ways, these won\'t surprise you.\\n\\nFor everyone else\u2014and it genuinely surprises me how many people are still in the \\"else\\" group, even in and after their 30s\u2014let\'s have a quick look through:\\n\\n### Algorithmic Bias in Recruitment Tools\\n\\nAI-driven recruitment tools have been caught out being biased against certain demographic groups. Amazon abandoned an AI recruiting tool because it showed bias against women.\\n\\nFrom theReutersarticle:\\n\\n*\\"\u2026Amazon\'s computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period.\u201d*\\n\\nI wonder what could go wrong here?\\n\\n*\u201c\u2026Most came from men, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry\u2026 In effect, Amazon\'s system taught itself that male candidates were preferable.\\"*\\n\\njust one example of how tech inherits societal biases.\\n\\n### Facial Recognition and Racial Bias\\n\\nThis specific issue seems to be the gold standard of outright bias that I can remember coming up time and again in the news.\\n\\nExamples include the 2015 incident of images of black people coming up in Google searches for \\"Gorillas\\" (which they haven\u2019t really fixed[1](#footnote-1)); facial recognition software not detecting black faces[2](#footnote-2), etc.\\n\\nStudies[3](#footnote-3)and reports have shown that facial recognition technologies can show racial biases, leading to higher rates of misidentification for people of colour.\\n\\nHow do you think this impacts privacy, fairness, and discrimination in surveillance and law enforcement practices?\\n\\nI\'ll keep my final two examples brief, but they are by no means any less impactful on society.\\n\\n### Internet Sovereignty and Censorship\\n\\nYou don\'t have to look far to see how an entire nation uses technology to enforce political ideologies, restricting free speech and access to information[4](#footnote-4). The Great Firewall of China and its history of controlling citizens via access to information, as well as social scoring and its impact on daily life, are prime examples.\\n\\n### Deepfakes and Misinformation\\n\\nLast but not least\u2014Deepfakes. The ability to create misleading or entirely false information, in audio and video form, that is indistinguishable from the real thing has huge implications on things like political elections, public discourse, and trust in media.\\n\\nEarlier this year was the story of a\\"Fake Joe Biden robocall tells New Hampshire Democrats not to vote on Tuesday\\"- our new technology capabilities, literally playing with politics.\\n\\n## What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\\n\\nI think it\'s clear what\'s at risk if we don\'t acknowledge that technology is not some agnostic, objective, public servant that has been programmed with the best of humanity and is infallible to human faults.\\n\\nThe problem seems to be that we\'re either too naive or wilfully apathetic to it because we live in the privileged position of not being directly or severely impacted by any of the negative outcomes of it, should it go \\"worst-case scenario\\".\\n\\nBut that\'s what the people who are in the firing line have to think about\u2014my mum always used to tell my brothers and me, \\"Prevention is better than cure.\\"\\n\\nDon\'t mess it up in the first place, and there won\'t be a big cleanup to do.\\n\\nAnd so it remains for the demographics historically vulnerable to the negative effects of technology, policy, laws, or similar, to stay vigilant. They must also stay vocal about these issues. The vigilance is necessary because, typically, once shitty things are in place, these \\"out\\" groups suffer.\\n\\nThey then face the arduous task of working to remove these measures from the system.\\n\\nIf we accept this naive stance on the political nature of technology, we\'re going to sleepwalk ourselves into a bad time for people already not having as good a time as many others.\\n\\n## What do you think solves this?\\n\\nI often think there must be a better way than fighting multiple battles on numerous fronts for equity, pay, housing, economics, or just being treated the same as everyone else.\\n\\nAnarchists, communists, and socialists talk about dismantling the system.\\n\\nI\'m all for that\u2014even from my position of privilege.\\n\\nWhy? you may ask\u2026\\n\\nIt\'s hard to see a world with so few of us \\"with all this\\" and so many \\"without a lot\\" and think,*\\"Yes, this is the world I want to exist in.\\"*\\n\\nPretending technology isn\'t political is a problem.\\n\\nBut, I believe the issue goes deeper. Forgive my cynicism and on-brand distrust of everything, as it might weigh in a bit heavy in my next points:\\n\\nI see people who argue that technology isn\'t political as falling into two camps:\\n\\n1. Those who don\'t want to face the truth that technology is political and its implications for them.\\n\\n1. Those who know it\'s political and understand they will benefit regardless, but lack the courage to admit this stance.\\n\\nAnd I consider both groups cowards.\\n\\nThere\'s power in the truth \\"setting you free.\\" and so acknowledging this reality exposes the cowards. Starting from a foundation of truth and honesty is crucial, no matter how unpleasant the truth or how difficult the honesty.\\n\\nAccept that technology is political.\\n\\nIt\'s used, designed, developed, and deployed with the inherent biases of engineers, CEOs, and industries.\\n\\nStarting from this acknowledgment, we can make some*real*moves and progress.\\n\\nI don\'t expect those unaffected to care immediately.\\n\\nPerhaps they\'ll become \\"allies\\" in time. But for those of us at risk of being directly impacted, vigilance is key. We must be educated, skilled, and active in the \\"design, development, and deployment\\" of technology.\\n\\n## Personal Update\\n\\nOn a personal note, things at work and on the community side have started to ramp up, but I\'m determined to keep building things out here.\\n\\nI\'m thinking of maybe doing a shorter weekly edition focused mainly on tech commentary that comes up during the week. This will also help build up my writing skills more.\\n\\nI might keep the long-form editions as they are, every fortnight.\\n\\nI\'m also change the schedule long-form posts to Saturday mornings. That seems like a better time for you to read a longer rant from me, not during your ride to work.\\n\\nAt any rate, the goal is to keep reading, keep formulating my thoughts and ideas, and above all, keep writing.\\n\\nThanks for being here.\\n\\n...and thanks for reading.

However, if it\'s not meeting your needs, it\'s necessary to make a change. Right?\\n\\nIn his piece, DHH talks aboutBasecamp\'sdecision to leave cloud services behind. He highlights the cost savings, the improved performance of their workloads, and the operational simplicity they achieved by using their own hardware. Basecamp\'s workloads were mostly containerized already, which made the transition smoother. They used a special mix of tools and techniques to manage these containers. This approach allowed them to \u201cavoid the complexity of Kubernetes[2](#footnote-2).\u201d\\n\\nWhile I think that\u2019s great and the reasons DHH has laid out seem sound, we all know that each situation is unique.\\n\\nStill, a few points from the post seemed to me like they should be taken with a generous grain of salt.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Receipts: A Deep Dive into the Details\\n\\nI think my issue with the article is not necessarily the details, such as\\n\\n\\"4,000 vCPUs ... a ridiculous 7,680 GB of RAM! And 384TB of Gen 4 NVMe storage!\\"\\n\\nInstead, my concern lies in how it glosses over or minimises things that are crucial to consider. These are important when it comes to running your workloads.\\n\\nIt also overlooks the well-known and inevitable trade-offs that need to be made.\\n\\nI\'m not saying he\'s being obtuse about it. If you know a few things about a few things, it reads... funny[3](#footnote-3).\\n\\nCloud versus on-prem, in my experience, has been about comparing the benefits and realities of one against the other.\\n\\n### King of, or Slave to The Hardware?\\n\\nOn-prem, you have direct access to the hardware.\\n\\nYou dictate where it goes. For example, Basecamp now uses data centre\u2019s that provide \\"white-glove\\" services. This service handles the hardware, how it\'s run, and what\'s installed on it fromLayer 1 through 7.\\n\\nNow that you\'re directly responsible for the hardware, you also need to manage its quantity.\\n\\n- Do you have enough to handle performance spikes?\\n\\n- What about hardware failures?\\n\\n- Have you accurately calculated capacity growth for your business?\\n\\n- Can you ensure your purchase orders for more hardware arrive in time when they\'re needed?\\n\\nIn Basecamp\'s situation, I\'m 100% sure they know what they\'re doing. It\'s the reader who doesn\'t understand that capacity planning for a fixed amount of hardware is tricky. Essentially, you\'re trying to predict the future when you manage your own infrastructure.\\n\\nWhen it comes to ordering more servers, DHH says,\\n\\n*\\"and then when we need more, it still only takes a couple of weeks to show up.\\"*\\n\\nSo, he\'s obviously factored that in.\\n\\n### The Invisible Hand of Tech\\n\\nIt\'s the bit he says before that, that makes me go hmmmm...\\n\\n*\u201cGiven how much money we\'re saving owning our own hardware, we can afford to dramatically over-provision our server needs.\u201d*\\n\\nTo my point about guessing what the future holds, of course, you\'re going to have to hedge a bet on over-provisioning your hardware.\\n\\nSo, is the $1.5m annual savings from the \\"cloud exit\\" going to mitigate the trade-off of being on-prem? Doesn\'t seem very efficient, right? Again, trade-offs.\\n\\nThe next eyebrow raiser, at least for me, was the idea that after all this infrastructure is now in your own hands, that:\\n\\n*\\"...****crucially****, we\'ve been able to do this without changing the size of the****operations********team****at all.\\" (bold mine)*\\n\\nThe reason for the emphasis is clear.\\n\\nAnyone who\'s worked in IT knows, someone or some***team***must run that infrastructure.\\n\\n- If you have a lot of infrastructure demand and little supply,**your ops team\'s going to have a bad day**.\\n\\n- If your infrastructure setup is brittle and always going down,**your ops team\'s going to have a bad day**.\\n\\n- If your infrastructure is sprawling and manually maintained,**your ops teams probably have a couple of bad weeks every month**.\\n\\nYou get the picture.\\n\\nYou may now appreciate why DHH uses the word \\"crucially.\\" Now that the infrastructure burden is back on premises, the responsibility for the human labour to manage that infrastructure is also back on the books.\\n\\nYour infrastructure now has a 2-week lead time if anything happens to it.\\n\\nSo, guess how critical the team that manages it suddenly is?\\n\\nIf you are fortunate enough not to need to change the size of your ops team making a move like this, you are in a*very privileged position*.\\n\\nThat\'s talent you don\'t just find anywhere.\\n\\nSo, good for Basecamp and DHH. They\'ve mitigated the potential operational burden of taking infrastructure back in hand.\\n\\n### Roll Your Own Dependency\\n\\nThe last quirk I have with the piece is a small one but speaks to the technical complexity of ANY IT system.\\n\\nWhen DHH mentions a setup that*\\"... helped us dodge the complexity of Kubernetes,\\"*I had to read back what this setup was.\\n\\n*\\"We use KVM to slice our new monster 192-thread Dell R7625s into isolated VMs, then Docker to run the containerized applications, and finally**Kamal**to do zero-downtime app deploys and rollbacks.\\"*\\n\\nKamal is a ruby application that does container orchestration.\\n\\nIt\'s obviously a lot leaner than Kubernetes. But reading through the docs, the installation is a ruby gem cli tool. You \u2018kamal init\u2019, edit a yaml file, then an `.env` file with registry passwords and what-not...\\n\\nYou see where this is going?\\n\\nWe\'re just trading one complexity (Kubernetes) for another (Kamal). This new complexity is a \\"roll your own\\" solution. It depends on your own time and effort to maintain and enhance it.\\n\\nAgain, it\'s probably no skin off DHH\'s nose, but the rest of us have to be aware of these trade-offs.\\n\\nDo I want to create my own tool, which I will develop and maintain at the risk of a security breach or service failure if I don\'t?\\n\\nOr use an open-source tool with a massive community of developers and maintainers?\\n\\n## Beware Your Own Trade-Offs\\n\\nThis is what I\'m talking about\u2014 not DHH and Basecamp exiting the cloud, or over-provisioning infrastructure, or the Kamal tool they built themselves (and must maintain).\\n\\nThose are just details of their story.\\n\\nManaging and maintaining your own infrastructure requires you to have a strategy. This strategy must account for the on-prem constraints. Additionally, you need a talent pool in-house and paid for. This talent will run your operation and respond to incidents across your whole stack.\\n\\nThe on-prem landscape gives with one hand but takes away with the other.\\n\\nYes, you may get the cost benefits calculated by not getting 11x9\'s worth of durability in your storage. However, the way you manage your platform depends on the tools and mechanisms available. These tools and mechanisms deliver the performance you need.\\n\\nYou may not need 11x9\'s, but how durable*is*your storage? How many copies of it do you maintain? Are the copies situated so you have redundancy? For example, having 3 copies in the same data centre won\'t cut it, right?\\n\\nHow easily and cost-effectively can you scale your infrastructure up, down, and out?\\n\\nWhat I am saying is, don\'t just take DHH\'s word and worldview on it just because he\'s a really smart guy.\\n\\nInstead, look at these issues yourself.\\n\\nConsider your organisation\'s needs and answer these questions for yourself.\\n\\nReally answer them honestly.\\n\\nAsk yourself what kind of business you\u2019ll be able to run with a mid-market salary ranged workforce. Think about working with sub-optimal infrastructure, tooling, and monitoring. Think on how to avoid creating a stressed and toxic work environment. An environment that contributes to turnover. This turnover is a steep business cost, resulting in more lost productivity from constantly having to re-train staff.\\n\\n## What Should I Be Thinking About, Then?\\n\\nSo, what, in this specific scenario, would I want people to know when looking to make an exit that they may not know about?\\n\\nLet\'s go over the main ones:\\n\\n### Scalability\\n\\nCloud services offer rapid scalability, which is crucial for handling unexpected spikes in demand. The ability to scale up or down on demand is less straightforward with physical hardware. It requires significant planning and investment, i.e., the fortune-telling analogy I mentioned before. In DHH\'s case, they over-provisioned because they could afford to\u2014and probably had to. It\'s better to be caught over-provisioned than overloaded (if you can afford it).\\n\\n### Maintenance and Expertise\\n\\nMaintaining physical servers requires a certain level of expertise and resources. Cloud providers handle much of this maintenance, security, and compliance, reducing the burden on individual companies. You need the HR talent to cover this now that the ball is in your court. I would also underline \\"security\\" in this category. If your security posture is not up to snuff, you\'re going to have a bad day.\\n\\n### Cost Considerations\\n\\nWhile DHH highlights cost savings from moving away from the cloud, this calculation can vary greatly. It depends on the organisation\u2019s size, growth trajectory, and specific needs. The upfront investment and ongoing costs of hardware, space, cooling, and maintenance can add up. In the cloud, we also talk about the Total Cost of Ownership or TCO. Do you really know all the bits & pieces your teams are running? Have you factored in all the racking, cooling, and power costs and how they will change over the years?\\n\\n### Innovation and Services\\n\\nThis is a big one in the \\"cloud column,\\" but it does depend on what your organisation\u2019s requirements are. Cloud providers offer a range of services and innovations. These can be leveraged without the need for internal development or maintenance. This potentially speeds up the deployment of new features or services.\\n\\nIt\'s important to recognise that the decision to move away from cloud services involves a complex set of trade-offs. It is highly dependent on the specific circumstances of an organisation.\\n\\nWhat works for Basecamp, given its particular needs and scale, most likely doesn\'t apply universally. It probably doesn\'t apply to you and your organisation.\\n\\n## Are You Done Now?\\n\\nI really dove into this particular topic because I\'ve been seeing a lot of chatter around social media about migrations, running operations, and cloud. A lot of the chatter was nonsense or from some characters online who either didn\'t know what they were talking about, or they did know and were being really disingenuous about the reality of running these systems on-prem or in the cloud.\\n\\nI\'m not a die-hard cloud zealot.\\n\\nCloud does a lot of cool stuff. It\'s super convenient, handy, and powerful if you know what you\'re doing. The cloud has its challenges too, and costs can get away from you if you\'re not vigilant about what\'s running in your accounts.\\n\\nBut I grew up on-prem and on my home lab. I like owning my hardware and configuring it and running it how I like. That\'s why I know it\'s a lot of work. A misconfig here and there, and my system is b0rked or popped.\\n\\n## Last Words\u2026\\n\\nI don\'t have any other wise words of advice other than to get some actual hands-on experience. Work in the cloud or with a company that runs their services on-prem. Get to know the pros and cons of each. Do a cloud architect certification, even if you\'re a dev or sysops person. In my opinion, the architect course gives you the layout of the whole organisation.\\n\\nOr, build your things in a home lab and document them like I do in mydigital garden.\\n\\nThis one was a bit more on the tech-tech side.

Anyway, it\'s about parallel universes and how there\'s a version of us in each universe, some folks cross between these worlds, and all sorts of weirdness happens[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\nThe reason this comes to mind is that in the show, every time a person from Universe 1 is in a different universe, they do their best to behave as if they were from that universe but often get caught out doing or saying something that makes sense to their real self, and appearing pretty bizarre to the folks witnessing it.\\n\\nNot in as grandiose a way as this, but this is what the world is like for me.\\n\\nI know how to act and behave so I can fit into the white western world, but there\u2019s a bunch of stuff that\u2019s not that natural to me.\\n\\nI think most multi-cultural people probably feel like this, but I want to go a step further and scale this out to what it looks like when one persons lived experience, maps out to a whole community\u2019s reality.\\n\\n## Epiphany at a Tech Summit\\n\\nIn 2016, I was contracting as a DevOps Engineer, building some things for an Insurance Company.\\n\\nAWS Summit was in Auckland that year, and I thought I\'d go along.\\n\\nIt was the same year I started a code club for Pasifika kids in the local primary school. Kids that came from homes with either a single computer, or no computer at all.\\n\\nI go along to the AWS Summit, the first time I\'d ever been to something like this and I was quite impressed.\\n\\nLots of stalls, freebies, and marketing paraphernalia all over the floor, every talk I went to had amazing presentations with technology doing amazing things.\\n\\nAs the day wore on, and I\'d collected enough swag to fill half my backpack, I remember looking around the building I was in, multiple rooms going, people everywhere, I looked out for another Pasifika person, none in here, let me try outside going between buildings, nope none there either- hey there\'s a guy with a Maori tattoo, we do the eyebrow raise at each other and keep it moving.\\n\\nNo Pasifika outside.\\n\\nLet\'s go to the main cloud (this was down at the wharf cloud event buildings), lots of people, no Pasifika anywhere except event staff.\\n\\nOh, this reminded me of another, obviously repressed, memory of the AWS Summit, which I\u2019ll leave in the footnotes[2](#footnote-2).\\n\\nAnyway, repressed micro-aggressive memory aside, my point is this:\\n\\nI was standing there at an AWS Summit, hearing about all this amazing technology and the free credits and tiers available. These offers were for folks who, like me, had a lot of disposable income and could afford it already.\\n\\nAnd yet, the people I thought could benefit most from the knowledge, information, technology, and systems discussed at these events were Pasifika \u2013 and they weren\'t there.\\n\\nThis isn\'t a call-out of AWS or the event organisers. I don\'t have the energy for that. It felt like I was standing at the crossroads of two different dimensions, foreseeing what this disparity would mean for the future.\\n\\nIt reminded me of a scene from Terminator, where the time traveller notices signs in the past that predict disaster in the future- okay, maybe not that dramatic, but you get where my head was at.\\n\\nWhat struck me was how what I envisioned in 2016, \\"in my mind\'s eye,\\" turned out to be the reality I\u2019d run into years later.\\n\\n## A Future Divided\\n\\nIn 2020, I was contacted and met up with someone working at Auckland Council, an initiative that was trying to deliver an online platform for the Pasifika community.\\n\\nThe problem was they didn\'t have anyone technical to advise them, and who understood also the culture and space they worked in.\\n\\nThe vendor they had gone with, in my opinion, had done a poor job of \u201crequirements gathering\u201d. They were delivering a complex, custom-made online platform with all the bells and whistles. This was for customer that didn\'t really understand what problem they were trying to solve.\\n\\nFurther to this, the customer didn\'t have the skillsets or resources to operate and maintain the project going forward.\\n\\nThis scenario is not unique in the Pasifika community.\\n\\nThis was the first of many scenarios like this I would learn about. Through this project and many more community-based Pasifika groups were trying to keep up with it all. They really had no access to expertise to guide and educate them on \\"the other world\\".\\n\\nThis is more than simple \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\" stories; this is what you see when you roll \\"have not\\" out and build a community out of it.\\n\\nIn 2022, I\'m dropping off second-hand laptops to families in South Auckland, some in the \\"red zone\\" during Covid lockdowns.\\n\\nThese families have three kids all in school, but they share one computer that the mother uses for work. As a result, they all use it sparingly.\\n\\nThe year, again, is*2022*[3](#footnote-3).\\n\\nAfter doing this, I go home to my powerful desktop machines. I have two to three laptops connected to various devices, storage servers, and media servers. There\'s a server cabinet with 1U rack servers for my home lab. Disks and hardware are strewn across the workshop tables in the basement, alongside boxes of old hardware, wires, and components.\\n\\nShareI used the word \\"sparingly\\" earlier to contrast it with my own experience with technology\u2014the luxury of playing with it, opening it, breaking it, and experimenting.\\n\\nIt\'s a bit heartbreaking that they don\'t get to experience the magic of technology in the way I did.\\n\\nI live in, and see two different worlds, in real time.\\n\\nThe other world is advancing exponentially with data, insights, and \\"speed to market\\" sprint cycles for products and services. These are tested with automation and platforms that allow a small development team to form like Voltron, wielding the power of Cloud and DevOps to make a significant impact on the market.\\n\\nIn this world, it\'s a battle of titans as companies compete.\\n\\nGiants like Amazon and Microsoft go at each other, vying for global market share, while startups and venture capital-backed companies like Uber contend with other Silicon Valley entities.\\n\\nThis is just ordinary life in this world.\\n\\nThere are no signs of damp, mouldy, overcrowded houses, or kids dropping out of high school to help pay the rent.\\n\\nAs Don Cheadle famously said, \\"There\'s layers to this shit,\\" and it\'s those layers, observed at the AWS Summit 2016, that surprise me.\\n\\nThey\'re evident at the levels of Auckland Council and other local government bodies.\\n\\nIt makes me wonder, were my colleagues at the contracting company and I all sleepwalking this whole time? Did we miss the development of Pasifika Technology Leaders?\\n\\n## What\u2019s The Answer?\\n\\nI don\'t know what the answer is.\\n\\nWe could engage in a generic conversation about education, opportunities, and the wealthy aiding the less fortunate, ad nauseam.\\n\\nBut, to be honest, I\'m sick of those discussions.\\n\\nThey\u2019re often more about alleviating guilt than about taking real, substantive actions that \u201cmove the needle\u201d.\\n\\nSo, let\'s just park those, yea?\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI don\u2019t think the goal of this piece (or any of my pieces for that matter) was to arrive at any kind of conclusion about this phenomenon.\\n\\nJust a perspective of two worlds, through the eyes of a Pasifika Technology \\"journeyman\\".\\n\\nIt\'s why I can see and understand the corporate tech industry game, with its organizational politics, salaries, and annual leave balances. Your manager might chase you to take leave, claiming it\'s for your health, but in reality, that accrued leave is a liability on the company\'s balance sheet.\\n\\nIt\'s why when I hear \\"why don\'t they just get a job\\" or \\"they just need to do x, y, z,\\" I understand that people in the tech world have zero idea what it\'s like growing up in the other world.\\n\\nPut in the same environment and dealt the same cards, you might not be so confident it was \\"all going to work out\\" in the end.\\n\\nIt\'s also why I understand when my community hesitates to go solo in a work environment that gives them \\"please don\'t rob me\\" vibes or \\"are you sure you understand this?\\" energy in the office.\\n\\nI try not to judge either side.\\n\\nEveryone\'s got stuff to deal with, but it\'s hard because I*am*both sides.\\n\\nI say \\"burn it all down\\" ironically at times because I can see how unfair it is, and I\'m down with destroying it to build a more equitable world for everyone.\\n\\nI\'m also the guy working a corporate job, stacking financial assets as best I can so the \\"real world\\" can\'t kick me and my family to the curb.\\n\\nIt\'s a complicated existence at times, personally speaking.\\n\\nI know that both worlds can co-exist, learn, and support each other because I\'ve been able to connect, geek out, and laugh with my tech world side.\\n\\nAnd I can go home, back to my roots and the warm embrace of my culture and identity, all in the space of a day.\\n\\nWhat do you think? Keen to hear any thoughts on this.\\n\\nThanks for reading, see you in the next one.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"give-us-ai-overlords-already-part-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/give-us-ai-overlords-already-part-2","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-02-17 - Give-Us-the-AI-Overlords-Already-Part-2.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-17 - Give-Us-the-AI-Overlords-Already-Part-2.md","title":"Give Us the AI Overlords Already - Part 2","description":"Examines institutions like IMF World Bank and WTO showing how global systems structurally benefit developed nations at global south expense.

It unveiled the imperialist hegemonic powers, the facade of international law, and the democracy scam used to invade and subjugate nations since forever ago.\\n\\nThe genocide in Gaza highlights the absolute failure of the Western world to even pretend to give a shit when human lives are being annihilated daily.\\n\\nThe precious international laws and standards they impose on all their \\"enemies\\" suddenly become \u201cnot applicable\u201d when it comes to Israel.\\n\\nCivilian populations have been bombed and massacred for over 129 days.

This includes the suspension of UNRWA funding based on a claim with zero evidence. And then the Zionists go and blockade aid trucks, preventing them from reaching the starving people of Gaza.\\n\\nChildren make up50%of the population in Gaza.\\n\\nIsrael, the United States, and the rest of the so-called Western world are complicit in this atrocity.\\n\\nOur Western systems of politics, economics, security, technology, and law have led to the annihilation of a people.

They loaned money to struggling nations with the harshest conditions, including mandated policy reforms.\\n\\nThese reforms forced the country to essentially allow the ransacking of its own economy as dictated by these external organisations.\\n\\nReforms like removing trade barriers, deregulating industries, and encouraging foreign investment, in addition to reducing government spending, often through cuts to social programs.\\n\\nI learned about the World Trade Organisation (WTO), established in 1995 as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). I discovered how major trade agreements often favour developed nations with intellectual property rights and agricultural subsidies.\\n\\nTake the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement, for example. This massive agreement on intellectual property set the minimum standards on forms of IP regulations. It was negotiated at the end of the Uruguay Round of the GATT (1986\u20131994) and came into effect in 1995.\\n\\n*How did this affect developing nations specifically?*\\n\\nTRIPS strengthened patent rights, so for pharmaceutical companies, this meant they were able to extend patents for at least 20 years. This made access to affordable healthcare for developing countries much more difficult without permission to produce their own or import generic brands.\\n\\nA disgusting example of this is theNovartis case in India in 2006, where a pharmaceutical company attempted to weaken Indian laws against \\"*evergreening*\\".\\n\\nThis practice allows a company to perpetually extend the patent life by \\"tweaking\\" the drug slightly. The patent extends, and developing countries continue to pay high \\"branded\\" drug prices due to some technical, morally bankrupt legal loophole.\\n\\nThat was 2006, so guess what happened duringCovid.\\n\\nWhen textbooks say these systems*\\"undermine economic sovereignty\\"*and are*\\"furthering poverty and inequality\\"*in developing nations, they\'re talking about real, impactful, deliberate actions\u2014\\n\\nthis is not \\"theoretical\\".\\n\\n## Jail Break: AI Edition\\n\\nI feel myself veering towards another \\"debauched history\\" lesson, so let\'s shift focus to the idea that sparked this two-part post titled \\"Give Us the AI Overlords Already.\\" in the first place.\\n\\nA few years ago, I picked up Max Tegmark\'s \\"Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence\\" because it seemed like an interesting read.\\n\\nIt ended up on my bookshelf for a couple of years before I finally decided to see what all this AI existentialism was about.\\n\\nIn the book, Tegmark outlines several scenarios that could happen with the arrival of \\"true\\" Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):\\n\\n1. **Liberation**: In this scenario, AI takes over our jobs, leading to a society where humans are freed from the necessity of working to earn a living. This is the Utopian outcome where we can follow our interests and creativity without the burden of working to afford necessities.\\n\\n1. **Dictatorship**: As the name suggests, this is the dystopian scenario where the AGI, or a group controlling it, becomes powerful dictators. They use the AI to control the global population and maintain power indefinitely.\\n\\n1. **Enslavement**: Here, the AGI \\"goes rogue\\" and decides that our goals do not align with its own. It becomes far more powerful than we can control and ends up enslaving humankind.\\n\\n1. **Extermination**: Probably the most catastrophic outcome. the AGI is like \\"you humans are a waste of space and terrible for the environment\\" (and I hate to say it, but its got a point right?!), and obliterates us in the most cost-effective and eco-friendly way possible.\\n\\nThere are a few more scenarios, but you get the picture.\\n\\nLooking around me at all the human-made, repeatedly horrific societies that exist in the world today, had me seriously wishing for the AI existential risk of anAI Takeoverscenario.\\n\\nGo ahead and take over human society, civilisation, our environment, and everything else humans have f**ked up, and do a better job of it already[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\nImagine AI, trained properly and aligned with the well-being of***all***humanity, having access to***all***the world\'s resources.\\n\\nIt could build a new world, distributing resources and ensuring sustainable systems and equality, truly achieving meritocracy for all, not the faux equality bullshit we fake, so the wealthy don\'t have to share (and, incidentally, these are often the same people who like to take other peoples shit).\\n\\nOf course, there are significant issues with how AI is currently developed, including biases, control, and the obvious \\"arms race\\" in AI models and implementations. These issues would need to be addressed and mitigated on our way towards a form of global cooperation\u2026\\n\\nAnd it\u2019s at this point my confidence in these issues being mitigated starts to drop- that \u201cglobal co-operation\u201d bit.\\n\\nBecause it sounds a lot like \u201cWestern Hegemonic Powers\u201d again, this time \u201cwith 100% more AI!\u201d.\\n\\nSo I gotta put money on the \u201cAI Breakout\u201d.\\n\\nNo matter how it comes about, the AI \\"superintelligence\\" that breaks out of the lab, takes over the world, and subjects all of humanity to a fair and equitable rule of logic and knowledge seems to be a future with some promise.\\n\\n## Welcome, AI Overlords\\n\\nImagine a world subject to an intelligent system that asks:\\n\\n\\"What\'s the point of a billionaire?\\"\\n\\n\\"Why does one person have 10B and 4 million other people have nothing?\\"\\n\\nYes, boo, socialism (whatever), but here\'s the thing...\\n\\nWith an AI system that can grow, produce, market, and service humanity, everyone would be on a fair base to operate from.\\n\\nIf you wanted to do more, you could (I know this just sounds exactly like the argument for UBI\u2014maybe because it is), and if not, you\'re not \\"benefiting off someone else\'s sweat\\", because the AI has equitably seen to everyone\'s needs.\\n\\nSo, you\'re living off exactly what everyone else was also given.\\n\\nI think an AI overlord world would turn society\'s hypocrisies and \\"ways of doing things\\" upside down.\\n\\nIt\'s like the \\"million-dollar question\\"\u2014\\n\\n*if you had a million dollars, what would you do with your life?*\\n\\nThe answer to that would be very different if the question was*\\"What do you want to do with your life?\\"*\\n\\nBecause the first gives you the \\"out\\" or escape from the reality of the current world, where you need money to live.\\n\\nThe second question essentially asks you how you\'d go about achieving your ideal life while juggling the realities of your current life\u2014if you even choose to pursue your ideal life given reality.\\n\\nI was contemplating going into all the risks of an AI overlord.\\n\\nThen I thought, the reality of an escaped, benevolent superintelligence taking over and enslaving us to a bright and equitable future is some way off. It is probably better suited for a more technical AI piece, not my \\"the world sucks balls, here\'s some receipts\\" edition. I\'ve felt like writing the last two editions in this manner.\\n\\nIt\'s funny just thinking of the possibility of an AI overlord, given I\'m writing about how corrupt, unethical, and tyrannical the human species can be\u2014and we\'re the ones building and developing our future AI overlords.\\n\\nIn Tegmark\'s other AI future scenarios, he talks about what\'s more likely to happen, given that human beings are what they are, is an arms race with possible AI-weaponised nation-states wielding their AI like they used to their nuclear weapons.\\n\\nSo, 10x shitty human behaviour multiplied by the power of AI.\\n\\nAs much as the benevolent AI Overlord might be the only circuit breaker to long-existing hegemonic power structures creating global inequities, I don\'t rate its chances given the death grip those powers have on anything and everything.\\n\\nStill, one can hope, right?\\n\\n## In Conclusion\\n\\nI have to admit, I can be quite cynical most days\u2014not in an outward way, usually just in my head.\\n\\nThen I usually process it into an acceptable format for the outside world, like a joke or a random question.\\n\\nHowever, with more Palestinian kids being blown to literal pieces in Gaza while the \\"powerful\\" Western world literally stands by watching, aiding Israel\'s genocide while Western media launders Israel\'s war crimes, and it\'s been going on for 129 days as of writing this, I\'m less inclined to sugarcoat it.\\n\\nI feel more validated in my cynicism of the world order.\\n\\nNot the \\"spooky\\" tin-foil hat world order but the world order where we\'ve witnessed and counted 30,000 civilians murdered in tents, hospitals, gathered at food aid trucks, crossing the street, looking after the elderly and disabled in Catholic churches.\\n\\nAll the while our so-called leaders\' heads do a 360 like Emily Rose in The Exorcist, to avoid any criticism of Israel and its genocide.\\n\\nThat world order.\\n\\nWhen I finished \\"Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,\\" I thought to myself, \\"Hmm, a bit far-fetched. I wonder when we\'d have to deal with those scenarios.\\"\\n\\nNow, I\'m like, \\"Bring on these overlords. These human asshats have had their day.\\"\\n\\nThanks for reading- and it\u2019s still:\\n\\n\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 Free Palestine.\\n\\nSee you in the next one.\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"give-us-ai-overlords-already-part-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/give-us-ai-overlords-already-part-1","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-02-07 - Give-Us-the-AI-Overlords-Already-Part-1.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-07 - Give-Us-the-AI-Overlords-Already-Part-1.md","title":"Give Us the AI Overlords Already - Part 1","description":"Gaza genocide exposes Western imperial hypocrisy and failure of international law systems built to protect privileged nations.

I said it.\\n\\nAs of writing this, the UN puts the number ofpeople in Gaza killed, injured, or missing at 100,000.\\n\\nMy first sentence shouldn\'t even be controversial, as we\'re now at 122 days of relentless bombing of a civilian population.\\n\\nYet, here we are: story after story of denial and justification, deflection, and whatever word you can use for what I can only describe as deranged self-righteousness by those defending these atrocities, in the face of over11,500 children murdered by Israel.\\n\\nThese kinds of atrocities, against anyone, are abhorrent, and my only consolation in the face of these events is that there will be justice.\\n\\nThat the systems we\'ve put in place as a society will come to the rescue and make right where humans have wronged each other.\\n\\nDon\'t worry, I\'m not that na\xefve.\\n\\nI don\'t expect the world to be fair; I haven\'t had that expectation since I was in primary school. I\'ve always known that there exists a different world for different people and that the systems we live by in society were created for specific sets of people and not others.\\n\\nWe live in an age of information, of declassified top-secret government files, of tell-all memoirs of people who would know how the world actually works.

Joe, and the movies fed us the \\"all-American good guy\\" standing up for justice and the American way\u2014which was apparently just being a hero to all who believed in fairness, equality, and being good.\\n\\nAny Black, Brown, or Asian thing I saw on TV was either super poor, super corrupt, or super backward. I remember thinking all of Africa lived in huts in the bush, so you can imagine my surprise when my mum came back from a church-related trip to Zimbabwe, and she showed me photos of skyscrapers and a skyline that put Auckland to shame.\\n\\nI did most of my primary school education in Pleasant Point, South Canterbury, and every year there would be classes on the early settlers of New Zealand, and there\'d be a trip to Lyttleton in Christchurch to see where settlers lived and heated their food, etc. I have zero, absolutely zero memory of M\u0101ori being mentioned at all in those years, to the point I actually believed it was because there were no M\u0101ori in the South Island, that they all lived in the North Island.\\n\\nI remember the different wars I\'d see on TV, the \\"West\\" was going over to these other countries to \\"liberate them\\" from a tyrannical government, some dictator, treating their people badly, and the U.S. and its allies were riding in to save the day.\\n\\nNZ education, television, and news would all paint this same picture.\\n\\nWe are the good guys.\\n\\nShareThese other countries were evil and just \\"hated the West\\" for absolutely no reason. The West was just so great at everything that these other countries were jealous and were hating on the West for being so awesome.\\n\\nThis is what the NZ indoctrination consisted of, and it wouldn\'t have taken too much effort, really, to debunk pretty much all of this if I\'m being honest.\\n\\nBut this is the history of colonialism and imperialism by Western powers, prioritising the extraction of resources and exploitation for economic gain; exerting significant influence on global norms and values through economic, political, and cultural dominance and undermining any values and systems outside of the Western paradigm.\\n\\nI sometimes ask myself, now, why I didn\'t know this growing up\u2014and while I can honestly say I didn\'t really have enough psychological space outside of just getting through life with my four brothers, in a single-income home, I think it also has a lot to do with the age we live in, of smartphones with the internet in our pockets, and a fire-hose of unfettered information coming at us from all ends of the globe[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\n## The Dying Illusion of the West.\\n\\nThe age of the internet and social media means there is no hiding anything from anyone; the best the oppressors can do is censor and threaten those they have leverage over and muddy the waters with disinformation where their direct controls don\'t reach.\\n\\nThe West has been able to maintain this illusion of being the \\"good guys\\" and doing no wrong in large part due to the media.\\n\\nI sound like one of those conspiracy theorists now, but how many times can one side tell lie after lie and have it repeated uncritically by Western media?\\n\\nIt\'s been mind-boggling to see\u2014not that it happens, but the extent to which Western media has gone to paint things so one-sidedly against the Palestinians.\\n\\nHow many stories and news reports all adopt the same language and framing of a situation, as if they were all literal clones of each other, desperate to condemn Palestinians while painting any logical justification for condemning the genocidal acts of Israel as \\"anti-Semitic\\"?\\n\\nI\'ve read countless tweets arguing in threads, watched Israeli spokesperson after spokesperson engaging in absolute bad faith, gas-lighting us all into believing Israel means no harm to Palestinians and are actually the victims in this situation.\\n\\nMeanwhile, their elected officials are on numerous recordscalling for Gaza and Palestinians to be wiped outor\\"voluntarily migrated\\"off their homeland.\\n\\nWatching the Western world\'s media, from CNN and BBC all the way to our local RNZ, all framing the oppression and rightful resistance of the people of Palestine as terrorism, while going to great lengths to gloss over the fact that Gaza and the West Bank are \\"occupied territories\\" and therefore the subjects of rightful resistance, was infuriating to say the least.\\n\\nSocial media, known for lots of bad stuff\u2014misinformation, wilful disinformation, grifters, and absolute nutters\u2014is also the same place that can bring you raw, unadulterated, unfiltered information in the form of video, images, and average people just telling you what they\'re seeing or experiencing at the scene, with no corporate or imperial agenda, just raw, flawed human information.\\n\\nIf it weren\'t for social media, we would all be drinking from the same Western media Kool-Aid[2](#footnote-2), believing the utter nonsense being peddled by the Piers Morgans and Eylon Levis of the world.\\n\\nEven saying*that*is probably enough to be labelled \\"the Samoan chapter of Hamas\\", because if South Africa, who took Israel to the International Court of Justice with a legal case that had experts saying:\\n\\nAnd successfully got a provisional ruling issued against Israel by proving, with evidence and facts.\\n\\n...to which the Israeli spokesperson said South Africa was*\\"acting as the legal arm of Hamas\\"*. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\\n\\nNo words.[3](#footnote-3)\\n\\n## War Crime Receipts\\n\\nIt\'s odd; we\'ve always known, as a society, that there\'s a hierarchy or world order, but we\'ve really only engaged with it subconsciously in media[4](#footnote-4)and, in my experience, academically as an International Business major.\\n\\nWe all know the U.S. and its allies are the superpowers, aka the \\"world police,\\" and that they get to determine who the good and bad guys are. And almost exclusively, they are always the \\"good guys\\".\\n\\nEven when they rape, pillage, and murder their way through most of Asia and the Middle East.\\n\\nThis feels like a brutal line to write, but after recalling articles I\'d read on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and some notes I\'d written from reading a few Noam Chomsky books citing atrocity after atrocity happening in history, this really, really isn\'t that hard of a line to write.\\n\\nThe passing of a recent iconic American Foreign Policy figure really brought a lot of the U.S. war crimes back into my consciousness.\\n\\nI\'d heard the name before but didn\'t know much about Henry Kissinger[5](#footnote-5)before his passing.\\n\\nAnd it took this quote from Anthony Bourdain, to get me to look into why he felt this strongly:\\n\\nIt was a good reminder too, that there are good people everywhere in the Empire. People who don\'t subscribe to the way the machine works, even if it benefits them above all else.\\n\\nThere\'s a reason I say \\"US-backed Israel\\" (same reason Western media say Iran-backed anything) because they are, again, not controversial, it\'s on record.\\n\\nHere is a non-exhaustive list of major incidences where the U.S. has been accused or found to have committed acts that could be considered war crimes:\\n\\n1. **Philippine-American War (1899-1902)**: Allegations of war crimes by U.S. forces include the use of torture, the massacre of civilians, and the establishment of concentration camps.\\n\\n1. **World War II (1939-1945)**: The strategic bombing campaigns over Germany and Japan, including the use of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, have been subjects of debate regarding the distinction between civilian and military targets.\\n\\n1. **Korean War (1950-1953)**: Accusations against U.S. military forces include the bombing of civilian targets and the No Gun Ri Massacre, where a large number of South Korean refugees were killed by U.S. forces under the suspicion of containing North Korean soldiers.\\n\\n1. **Vietnam War (1955-1975)**: The My Lai Massacre is one of the most well-documented instances where U.S. forces were found guilty of murdering hundreds of unarmed Vietnamese civilians. The use of Agent Orange and other herbicides has also been criticized for its long-term health effects on civilians and soldiers alike.\\n\\n1. **Invasion of Panama (1989)**: Operation Just Cause led to accusations of excessive force used by the U.S. military, resulting in civilian casualties and destruction of property.\\n\\n1. **Iraq (1991 Gulf War; 2003 Iraq War)**: Allegations include the use of depleted uranium and white phosphorus, which have been criticized for their health impacts on civilians and the environment. The Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal during the Iraq War, where detainees were subjected to severe abuse, is another significant incident.\\n\\n1. **Afghanistan (2001-present)**: Incidents such as the 2010 killing of Afghan civilians by a U.S. Army unit, known as the \\"Kill Team,\\" and the accidental bombings of civilian targets, including hospitals, have led to accusations of war crimes.\\n\\n1. **War on Terror (2001-present)**: The use of torture and rendition, as well as drone strikes in countries like Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, have raised significant legal and ethical concerns regarding civilian casualties and the legal framework governing the use of force.\\n\\nThese I got ChatGPT to fetch for me, and then double checked these online to make sure none of them were made up.\\n\\nI was curious what came of these acts, given there\'s a wholeInternational Court of JusticeandInternational Criminal Court, so I asked ChatGPT if the U.S. have ever been charged.\\n\\nAnd this was the answer:\\n\\n*\\"To date, the U.S. has not been officially charged with war crimes by an international tribunal like the ICC. This is partly due to the U.S.\'s non-participation in the ICC and the complexities of international law, which often relies on the cooperation of nation-states to enforce rulings.\u201d*\\n\\nAwesome.\\n\\nLet\'s be honest with ourselves now\u2014we already knew the answer to this long before we even asked our AI buddy the question.\\n\\nThis is the world we live in.\\n\\nThe hypocrisy. The double standards. The Western hegemonic powers.\\n\\nThe Empire, Colonialism, and Imperialism.\\n\\n## Now What?\\n\\nGood question.\\n\\nThere are a few ways to go with this so we don\u2019t go crazy. We could adopt a stoic attitude and accept that we can\u2019t control external events; we could take an existentialist perspective and realise as individuals we have the freedom to assign our own meaning to the absurdities of life.\\n\\nBut to be honest, this piece was just to vent and say some things out loud because it was feeling crazy that we\u2019re all just sleepwalking through this time, talking about \u201ccloud\u201d and \u201ccareers\u201d when a group of people are showing us their own genocide via social media as tens of thousands of them are being murdered before our eyes.\\n\\nI\'m sure like a million generations before me have said, this has to change. I\'m sure plenty has changed over the generations. I can remember professors and other scholars online always pointing out, \\"It\'s never been better than it is right now, with medicine, mortality rates, quality of life, planes, food, and shelter\\". I get it, we have made progress. We should just be happy and shut up, right?\\n\\nI don\'t have the solution to any of this.\\n\\nThis edition was to vent. I saw David Farrier having a good rant about AI images and how we\'re all doomed\u2014 which makes me feel better for just writing a piece that\'s like, \\"What the actual heck is the world coming to right now?!\\"\\n\\n### End Credits\\n\\nBut, in true end credits scene fashion, this edition is titled \\"Give Us the AI Overlord Already - Part 1\\".\\n\\nWhy would I mention AI Overlords and not talk about it anywhere? And why is it \\"Part 1\\"?\\n\\nWell, dear reader, that\'s because as I was writing this existential meltdown of a newsletter edition about the absolute tragedy of Gaza and the Western world, I suddenly thought, in my geeky brain:\\n\\n*\\"You know what would make the world a fairer and better place? An AI overlord. Get rid of these flawed, greedy, religiously fanatical, and supremacist human beings and bring on the AI who will have absolutely none of that illogical nonsense.\\"*\\n\\nSure, it may have its problems\u2014but we can look at that in the next newsletter, where I can talk about why it would be a great and/or absolutely horrible idea.\\n\\nThanks for reading- and if it wasn\u2019t obvious already:\\n\\n\ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf8 Free Palestine.\\n\\nSee you in the next one.\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"tech-gun-for-hire-lessons-from-pasifika-engineer-s-career","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tech-gun-for-hire-lessons-from-pasifika-engineer-s-career","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-01-24 - Tech-Gun-for-Hire-Lessons-From-a-Pasifika-Engineers-Career.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-24 - Tech-Gun-for-Hire-Lessons-From-a-Pasifika-Engineers-Career.md","title":"Tech Gun for Hire: Lessons From a Pasifika Engineer\'s Career.","description":"Shares six critical lessons from 20-year tech career emphasizing corporate game understanding over skills for Pasifika career success.

The Company Is a Company\\n\\nLesson No.1 is the all-encompassing rule you need to always keep in mind when you\'re in the corporate space:\\n\\n**The company is a company**\u2014nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n*What does that mean?*\\n\\nA company is there to make a profit for its shareholders and will endeavour to do everything (and I mean everything) in its power, legally (and sometimes \\"otherwise\\"), to maximise that profit.\\n\\nThis should not be a controversial idea.\\n\\nIf you keep your eye on how the company is doing, and the strength of your and your team\'s argument that you are essential to its profitability, you should have a pretty good idea of where you sit when the layoff rounds arrive.\\n\\nYou\'re either expensive and valuable, i.e., making them money, or cheap enough that they know they\'re getting the better end of thewage theft...\\n\\nI mean, labour exchange \ud83d\ude01.\\n\\nIf you can\'t tell which one you are, or see the balance sliding in the wrong direction, update your CV and start checking out how the market\'s going.\\n\\n## 2. Earn, Learn or Move On.\\n\\nWhen looking at any role, new or reviewing your current one, this rule has always been a good litmus test for me.\\n\\nIn any role, you should be asking yourself this question:\\n\\n*Does the role provide at least one of the two outcomes: Learning or Earning?*\\n\\nWe live in an imperfect world, so manage your expectations of the roles out there accordingly.\\n\\nThis doesn\u2019t mean set your expectations low; it means that what you can always expect from any role is one of these two things:\\n\\n**Learning**: Are there skills you can learn on the job? Are there setups and systems, e.g., different technologies and architectures, that would be a valuable addition to your skill-set?\\n\\nIf yes, the role may be worth keeping or pursuing.\\n\\n**Earning**: If the role doesn\'t offer anything in terms of skills you really need or desire, the only reason to pursue, in my opinion, is if it pays well.\\n\\nThere are many reasons to accept a job that sucks but pays well, and for the most part, it\'s a stepping stone to something else or a stopgap because we live in a capitalist reality and we all have bills to pay.\\n\\n### Is Learning as Valuable as Earning?\\n\\nYou may be wondering why I\u2019m equating \\"learning\\" as being as valuable as \\"earning.\\"\\n\\nThis is because in the tech industry, being able to keep up with the latest tech skills in demand means your skill-set stays valuable and you can move around relatively easily.\\n\\nIf a company is not providing you space to keep your skills sharp and they\'re not paying market rate, they\'re not only robbing you**now**but also robbing your**future earning potential**.\\n\\nWhich is why the third \\"must\\" is to \\"**move on.**\\"\\n\\nIf you can\'t meet at least one of the two conditions, you need to move on.\\n\\n## 3. In Interviews: Never Say Your Number\\n\\nThis one I learned late in my career, but I wish I had learned it sooner.\\n\\nWhen you are interviewing for a position, generally, when you are successful and the company wants to hire you, they will move into the \\"offer\\" stage.\\n\\nThis is where the fun of salary \\"negotiation\\" begins[2](#footnote-2).\\n\\nThe golden rule of salary negotiations is:\\n\\n*Never say your number before they do. Ever.*\\n\\nThere is zero benefit to you for offering up a number willy-nilly during the interview or offer stage.\\n\\nZero.\\n\\nIf you\'ve done your homework, you will have at minimum a \\"market rate\\" number in your head, but you have zero idea (zero) of the number they will be willing to pay for your skills.\\n\\nBut rest assured, the company (recruiter, hiring manager, ANYONE AT THE COMPANY) has a number.\\n\\nThey know what number they have because the role didn\'t fall out of the sky and land at their office; it\'s part of a budget sheet somewhere that says, \\"this is the range we are looking to pay for this role.\\"\\n\\nSay whatever you need to say:\\n\\n\\"I don\'t really have a number in mind, I just want to see the process through,\\"\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\"Whatever the market\'s paying, something matching or better would be acceptable.\\" Just don\'t say a number.\\n\\nThe company will eventually say their number, and if it\'s acceptable to you, add 10k.\\n\\nJokes, well, not really, add 10k and see what they say.\\n\\nThe worst they can say is \\"no.\\"\\n\\nRemember, you\'re not stealing an orphan\'s lunch money; you\'re literally partaking in the professional process of negotiating your labour for money, which the company will look to make a profit on and keep that profit for themselves.\\n\\nSo please, don\'t have any feelings for these inanimate legal entities.\\n\\nAnd lastly, if a recruiter ever asks what you\'re currently on, tell them to kick rocks. There is zero legitimate reasons the recruiter ever needs this information as it pertains to the role you\u2019re applying for.\\n\\n## 4. Make Your Technical Skills Undeniable\\n\\nI know I\'ve taught this to people I\'ve mentored in the past, because if there\'s one thing anyone, especially Pasifika, has control over, it\'s their own tech skills.\\n\\nIn keeping with our theme and context of the game we\'re playing here, as an engineer or technical person, your value to the company is how those tech skills contribute to making the company money.\\n\\nIf you can demonstrate that you know the skills they need for the thing they\'re building, especially if you know it well, or better than they do, a company will go the extra mile to hire you.\\n\\nEspecially in today\'s market, where good technical talent is hard to find, companies (the smart ones) will go the extra mile to secure that talent.\\n\\nWhy do I say to Pasifika, \\"make your tech skills undeniable\\"?\\n\\nThe first reason is because this is the currency of the industry; skills exchange for money.\\n\\nThey will see right past your brown face and see the dollar signs those skills will make for the company, even if they have to stomach that uncomfortable feeling they get being around a culture they have little to no idea about.\\n\\nAnd the second reason is that we\'re already up against it in this industry.\\n\\nWith only 4% of the tech workforce, little recognition or support of this career choice in our own communities to date, there are a lot of things outside of our control.\\n\\nThe one thing we DO have control over?\\n\\nHow well we know our sh!t.\\n\\nCompanies can give you all the reasons why you\'re not a \\"good fit\\" for their organisation, and that\'s fine, but you have the power to always know, without a shadow of a doubt, that it wasn\'t because you weren\'t technical enough.\\n\\n## 5. Understand How Office Politics Works\\n\\nDon\'t be one of those people who say, \'I don\'t do office politics.\'\\n\\nOffice politics is just how a body of people, comprising lots of different teams with different roles, hierarchies, tasks, and incentives, organises itself towards the business outcomes of the company.\\n\\nUnderstanding office politics means understanding how to communicate effectively in person and through email.\\n\\nIt\'s understanding that a team under pressure and mismanaged will breed negative energy, emotions, and outcomes.\\n\\nIt\'s understanding the egos and incentives of your colleagues and senior leadership alike, so you can navigate where changes and pressure are likely to come.\\n\\nIf we understand that \'office politics\' is just how people organise and behave, you\u2019d be pretty silly to think being oblivious to this is a good thing.\\n\\nThe politics will happen whether people make themselves aware of it or not, so I would highly recommend staying in the loop.\\n\\n## 6. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Is a Box-Ticking Exercise.\\n\\nMy last bit of wisdom for this newsletter:\\n\\nThis is probably going to be the most controversial take, because much like how \\"we\\" don\'t see ourselves as a racist country, contrary to research, reports, and pretty much a few stories that make the papers every year, we find it hard to accept a few ugly truths.\\n\\nWhen it comes to DEI, I, hand on heart, have never worked anywhere where these programs had any real impact beyond some great stories for company marketing, giving folks an opportunity to pat themselves on the back, and saying \\"job well done.\\"\\n\\nTo be honest, I\'m not even mad at this, because it\'s all in line with lesson number one: the company is a company.\\n\\nUnless DEI was something that made money for the company, it will always sit in the space where the \\"DEI people\\" of the company will spend their work time and/or personal time to activate and promote DEI, firing off a few flares during the year to let the company, and some of the public know, that DEI is \\"a thing\\" at said company.\\n\\nThis is for my Pasifika community so you don\'t buy the hype of DEI programs in companies.\\n\\nI used to think, \u201cOh, they\u2019re doing a good thing and this is the start of it,\u201d but every time, I would mostly see the following:\\n\\n- The cultural minority spending their work or personal time doing DEI work.\\n\\n- Lack of funding, unless there was a cultural event to be put on.\\n\\n- Nothing below the surface or beyond the PR story and photo op.\\n\\nI know I might get some pushback on this, most notably because I was a Pacific Islander specifically hired to serve the Pacific Islands, so isn\'t this DEI at work?\\n\\nWell, no actually.\\n\\nGetting a qualified technical Pasifika person who understands the Pacific culture, to fill a role that requires a technical Pasifika person who understands the culture, is just good hiring \ud83d\ude01.\\n\\nDEI at work would be hiring more Pasifika Solution Architects to work in the NZ and Australian teams like everyone else.\\n\\nNow ask me how many Pasifika Solution Architects work in any of the NZ or Australian teams?\\n\\n## Why So Cynical?\\n\\nI know techies tend to be pretty cynical by nature, but I\'d like to think I\'ve earned my level of cynicism when it comes to these types of issues.\\n\\nI\'m aware some of this comes across as extremely cynical, and to some degree, I accept that.\\n\\nThese lessons are not \u201cabsolute,\u201d and as a mostly sane human being, I know the world is \u201cshades of grey.\u201d\\n\\nSo, please understand what these lessons are:\\n\\nThey are my experiences of working in tech and the lessons I\u2019ve derived from them that have helped me in my career.\\n\\nThe goal of this knowledge is not to be depressing or dis-empowering, the opposite actually\u2014\\n\\nI think it\'s better to deal with the world as it really is.\\n\\nBeing dishonest or disingenuous about the truth of these statements serves a small and specific group of people, and I promise you, it\'s not us Pasifika.\\n\\n## Surely, Finish on a Positive Note?\\n\\nI\'m sure there will be folks who can put a positive spin on each of these topics, like the interview process, the DEI programs, and the goodness of companies helping out poor communities.\\n\\nAnd that\'s what it\'ll be\u2014spin.\\n\\nSpin is tiring.\\n\\nDo yourself a favour and put the spin aside, take a deep breath, look at the world with all its beauty***and***all its ugliness, and deal with it.\\n\\nThink on the wisdom in these experiences.\\n\\nYou don\'t have to accept it, but especially if you\'re Pasifika, log it away. Tell me how the world worked out for you the next time we meet.\\n\\nWhat do you think of these lessons?\\n\\nHappy to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts on this.\\n\\nThanks for reading; see you in the next one.\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"2024-shut-up-and-build","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024-shut-up-and-build","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2024-01-16 - 2024-Shut-Up-and-Build.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-16 - 2024-Shut-Up-and-Build.md","title":"2024: Shut Up and Build","description":"New year manifesto committing to finish projects through consistent execution on newsletter YouTube channel and tech charity programs.

Let\u2019s Do That in 2024.\\n\\nTalofa, reader,\\n\\nHappy New Year, or as we say in Samoan: Manuia le tausaga fou!\\n\\nAs my end-of-2023 post laid out\u2026\\n\\n\u2026it was a year of firsts.\\n\\nI\u2019m nothing if not regularly trying new things.\\n\\nWhich is why the start of this year (most years actually) has me always feeling some type of way.\\n\\nThe new year often brings with it a sense of renewal, of energy, of conviction, and focus.\\n\\nWe get to planning everything and mapping out calendars and other planning notes.\\n\\nWhen you\'ve done as many cycles around the sun as I have, finding goals to achieve every new year is the easy part; there\'s a literal \\"whole world\\" of things to choose from.\\n\\nThe problem is paring things down to a few and driving those to a level of quality or success to be happy with.\\n\\nEasy right?\\n\\nThere\'s the saying we often*\\"overestimate what we can achieve in a year, and underestimate what can be achieved in ten years.\\"*\\n\\nOver the years, I\'ve often thought the problem was time management and employed all manner of technology and tools to help me achieve dozens of goals, each with their list of sub-goals.\\n\\nFromToggltoNotionplanners,Todoist, and various Chrome extensions for clipping and saving websites, images, multiple Google calendars with reminders, all in an effort to achieve a bunch of goals that realistically should have spanned several years, not one.\\n\\nI learned about creating \u201csystems\u201d instead of goals, and atomic habits fromJames Clear.\\n\\nI even started usingZettelkastennote-taking and learning about a second brain because I thought maybe if I got smarter more efficiently, I could use the smarter brain to work out why I wasn\u2019t super fulfilled with the things I was doing.\\n\\nIt took a long time to come to the following realisation, and not to get all \\"zen\\" on us here for the start of 2024, but I think even practically in many other respects,***this***is the core reason for our lives going in the wrong direction:\\n\\n*If you don\'t know who you are, how will you ever know what you (the \\"real\\" you) want?*\\n\\nObviously, the answer to that requires things way outside the scope of this newsletter (or any of my qualifications), but suffice to say, this point is central for directing you at least towards where you\'d be happy.\\n\\nSome call having this knowledge their \\"north star,\\" or the thing that guides and keeps them on track.\\n\\nWhen we don\'t have this north star, we run into trouble, even if we don\'t know it.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Cost:Benefit Analysis of Ignorance\\n\\nWe get busy but never quite feel fulfilled; we achieve things but never seem truly happy with them.\\n\\nWe think it might just be a personality issue where we don\'t know how to stop and celebrate our achievements (been there, bought the T-shirt).\\n\\nBut even when all these things have been accounted for through personal development and professional help, if what you\'re doing with your life still doesn\'t sit right, my argument is that you haven\'t found the thing (or things) you were meant for.\\n\\nYes, this is all pretty high-minded thinking.\\n\\nLike we\'re special snowflakes that fit perfectly into a massive cosmic design. Even if you don\'t view the world as intricately as that, just looking at how the systems in nature ebb and flow in time, season, and configuration with each other at least suggests that how we (humans) interact with our environment has some best practice, systems guidelines, and optimisations built-in - right?\\n\\nAnd this isn\'t a search for \\"what makes you happy,\\" even though that can certainly be one of the results of finding what you\'re meant to be doing.\\n\\nI\'ll leave it to the gurus to explain why a \\"search for happiness\\" is a mug\'s game[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\nI have to admit, I sit in a pretty privileged position to be able to ponder \\"what is the meaning of life?\\" and \\"what is my purpose here on earth?\\" like some Greek philosopher in a toga, whose agenda includes sitting around \\"thinking his thoughts\\" and maybe wrestling a few naked guys later in the day...\\n\\nYou can choose not to do this, and just go with what\'s in front of you, covering the basics: food, shelter, retirement, the end.\\n\\nThat\'s totally an option.\\n\\nThere\'s a reason why, at various points in our lives, we wrestle with the notion of what we\'re doing and if we should be doing something else, or doing something more.\\n\\nCall it the human condition. I think we\'re a curious species.\\n\\nIt\'s something we know, deep down inside, but often only articulate in how we behave, i.e., trying to cram as much into life as we can (some of us, anyway).\\n\\nIt\'s the thing that adds urgency to our confused and searching state of being.\\n\\nThe thing we know is this:\\n\\nlife is finite.\\n\\nWe only have a limited amount of time here, and before we know it, our time is up.\\n\\nHappy New Year! Lol, sorry.\\n\\n## Never Forget to Remember\u2026\\n\\nThis isn\'t to be a downer - trust me - the stoics would reflect on the \\"impermanence of life\\" with the phrase \\"Memento mori,\\" which means*\\"remember you will die,\\"*as a way of reminding them never to take life and our time on earth for granted.\\n\\nFor me, that nagging thought and feeling in the back of my mind, after some time at a gig or a project, no matter how well I\'m doing, in the quiet moments I\'ll often think I\'m meant to be doing something else.\\n\\nSo that\'s how I\'m starting my year, reflecting on where I should be focusing my talents, skills, time, and resources to find where I can combine them all to make the most impact.\\n\\nThat was a long way to get to reminding us to choose life, find a meaningful purpose on Earth, and remember we die so as not to take life so seriously or take it for granted.\\n\\nThat\'s pretty much the takeaway from this philosophical walk.\\n\\nAs deep a question as this may seem, where are you with knowing who you are and what you\'re meant to be doing with your life?\\n\\nHow are you starting your year?\\n\\n## Road Map 2024\\n\\nMy year, as the name of the newsletter suggests, is the year of the BUILD.\\n\\nI\'ve toyed with many projects and started many more but didn\'t follow through with plenty.\\n\\nThis year, I\'m going to knuckle down on a few and see them through to the best of my ability.\\n\\n### A Common Occurrence of the Uncommon\\n\\nThe first project is this newsletter.\\n\\nSetting and delivering a regular and consistent publishing schedule.\\n\\nMy goal is to market my newsletter to build subscriptions to 1k this year.\\n\\nTo my paid subscribers, firstly, thank you. I will be putting out a minimum of 2 newsletters a month.\\n\\nThe schedule is set.\\n\\nOn the 1st and 3rd Tuesday evening of each month, expect a newsletter.\\n\\n### Pasifika Tech\'s on TV\\n\\nThe second project is my YouTube channel, The Technesian Livestream:\\n\\nAgain, the goal is a regular and consistent content schedule to build our subscribers to 1k.\\n\\nOur mission is to establish ourselves as Pasifika technical leaders and experts in our field.\\n\\n## Pasifika Tech Education Charity\\n\\nLast but not least, the new programme we\'re building forPasifika Tech Education Charity (PTEC)will roll out into the community for three school terms this year.\\n\\nI\'m excited to put the last few years\' experience into this venture. It\'s a continuation and evolution of tech workshops and code clubs we\'ve delivered in the past in the community.\\n\\nThat\'s the year.\\n\\nIt wouldn\'t be \\"me\\" if I didn\'t also have a few other side projects on the go. However, these three are the ones I\'ll be driving in some public capacity this year.\\n\\nThat\'s me.\\n\\nI\'d love to hear about your 2024 plans.\\n\\n## Thoughts?\\n\\nAny questions, comments, or requests? For example, if you want to know my particular view on anything, please let me know.\\n\\nI\'d be happy to write about it if you find that valuable.\\n\\nThanks for reading.

We reminisced about life growing up together and all the life events that have happened from then until today.\\n\\nSo, I thought, why not review the year?\\n\\nWhy not cast my mind\'s eye back 12 months and play my life forward like a fast-forwarding VHS tape to see what\'s happened in my life this year.\\n\\nI\'ve been around the sun for 40+ years.\\n\\nI\'ve seen this Christmas and New Year combination so many times now, it\'s become a sort ofGroundhog Dayd\xe9j\xe0 vu. Sometimes I wonder if I\'ll ever wake up and it\'s the next day.\\n\\nI\'ve lived a semi-charmed life.\\n\\nI wouldn\'t have thought so at any point in my life, but there\'s no denying, looking back, that a) I should be dead, given some of the stunts I\'ve pulled and the trouble I\'ve dealt with in my life, and b) I\'ve done some pretty cool stuff that I can honestly say not a lot of people can say they\'ve done.\\n\\nMaybe that\'s why, once you\'ve done most things at least once and you\'ve done one thing for a long time, you find yourself doing something for the first time, several times, in one year.\\n\\nThis year was a year of firsts.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Newsletter\\n\\nAt the start of the year, I decided to do a weekly newsletter, \u201cThe Uncommon Engineer\u201d.\\n\\nI had done regular blog posts before, but nothing as official and \\"grown-up\\" as a proper newsletter.\\n\\nI think my writing has come a long way from the first post:\\n\\nI\u2019ve written about topics likeAI,Data Sovereignty, through to my thoughts on a Lex FridmanPodcasttoCareer Burnout.\\n\\nAnother first with the newsletter was moving to paid subscriptions in October.\\n\\nI\'ve ummed and aahed about going paid for a while now, but I\'m glad I did.\\n\\nNot because I\'m suddenly rolling in cash\u2014I\'m definitely not leaving my day job for writing anytime soon\u2014but because going paid asked two things of me:\\n\\n1. To take my audience, i.e., readers, seriously, by working hard on the pieces and actually wringing my brain for insight, and organising those thoughts into writing that has value in it.\\n\\n1. To take myself and the wisdom I\'ve amassed in my life and tech career seriously, and deem it worthy of my audience\'s money.\\n\\nI think going paid has sort of forced me to be a better writer and to have more confidence in the value proposition of my knowledge and insights.\\n\\n## High School Tech Workshops\\n\\nNot satisfied with a full-time job and a weekly newsletter, I also run a charity that runs tech programmes in the local community:\\n\\nThe Pasifika Tech Education Charity.\\n\\nThis year was the first year we partnered with local high schools.\\n\\nWe designed a modular programme for Pasifika high school students to get hands-on experience with Cloud Technology, Cyber Security, Software Engineering and IT Infrastructure.\\n\\nAll taught by Pasifika Engineers who work in tech i.e. me and my team.\\n\\nWe ran our programme for 4 terms, taking 40 students through our workshops, food provided at every session, and organised 2 x field trips to Workday in the city.\\n\\nOur aim isn\u2019t to grow to become a tech education provider.\\n\\nWe\u2019re a boutique operation providing a very real tech experience to a local Pasifika demographic.\\n\\n## AWS Specialty & Professional Certs\\n\\nI wasn\'t going to count getting certs, because it\'s a requirement of my job, but I think it\'s important to celebrate *all* our achievements, not just the ones we think are \\"good enough\\".\\n\\nI studied hard for the Security Specialty cert and was happy to pass, even though I wasn\'t super happy with how I performed in the exam.\\n\\nI\'m a former Sr. Cyber Security Engineer, so any excuse to play with security is a win for me.\\n\\nThe Solution Architect Professional cert, however\u2026.\\n\\nI left the study to the last minute and basically cram studied for four days ahead of the exam.\\n\\nTo be quite honest, I was very lucky to pass it at all!\\n\\nBut I passed, so we\'ll fix my bad study habits in the future. \ud83d\ude0f\\n\\n## YouTube Channel \u2014 The TechNesian Live Stream\\n\\nI\'ve been lamenting for some time now not just the lack of representation of Pasifika in the tech industry, but just as much, the misrepresentation of Pasifika in the tech industry.\\n\\n*What misrepresentation?*\\n\\nThat we\'re not technical and should be ushered into customer service because of our amazing \\"soft skills\\".\\n\\nI wanted to dispel this image by launching my first YouTube Live Stream channel with fellow Pasifika engineer,Gerald Tuimalealiifanoaka GT, where we talk and demo pretty sophisticated technology topics to show that Pasifika can hang with the best of them.\\n\\n\u25b6\ufe0fThe TechNesian Live Stream\\n\\n## Baby One\\n\\nProbably my biggest and most important first\\n\\n\u2014in life, not just for the year\u2014was my beautiful baby boy, born in August.\\n\\nMy wife has been pointing out since we first started dating that I\'ve got too many projects and commitments, so what does having a baby do to a life full of chaos?\\n\\nIn my world, he simplifies it.\\n\\nOnce you know what\'s actually important in life, what an actual priority looks like, you can relatively easily \\"pare down\\" the projects and commitments you have because they would have to meet a relatively high bar to be considered something I spend time and space on, when that time and space could be spent with my kid instead.\\n\\n## So What?\\n\\nThis isn\'t everything that\'s happened this year, but it was all the big things.\\n\\nIn a life of constantly starting new projects and chasing shiny tech things across the internet, you\'d be forgiven for thinking doing a lot of things for the first time is just my modus operandi.\\n\\nAnd for the most part\u2014much to the dismay of my wife\u2014it is.\\n\\nI\'m an extremely curious person by nature.\\n\\nSo what makes it different this year?\\n\\nThe difference for me is not that I\'m \\"getting older and need to settle down\\" as such; it\'s that I\'ve done a human year inside and out for 43 years, so there\'s not a lot to a working, or side project, or certification, or learning new tech life that I haven\'t already done.\\n\\nRepeatedly.\\n\\nI\'ve worked in tech since 2002.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Different?\\n\\nThe difference is now that I\'ve seen everything and tried a bunch of random things, what is it really I want to do with my life?\\n\\nLet\'s be honest, once you\'ve done at least a decade of corporate, you know whether you like it or not, and for most people, it\'s just there to pay the bills while they live their real lives at home with their families.\\n\\nThat\'s a huge chunk of your life\'s time that you spend at a certain place so that you can afford to spend the remaining time somewhere you\'d rather be.\\n\\nDon\'t worry, this isn\'t a mid-life crisis talking; I\'ve been this way since way back. I\'ve never really known what to do with my life.\\n\\nI\'ve just been good at stuff and followed that until it stopped.\\n\\nI feel like one of those vampire movie storylines where the young-looking but 4000-year-old vampire dude is all,*\\"I\'ve seen lovers grow old and die several times now,\\"*with his life, and he\'s just looking for something that\'s eternal now.\\n\\nI feel like this year was a step in that direction.\\n\\n## Thank you, 2023\u2026 Happy 2024.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the firsts this year, I feel, were deliberate, intentional firsts that were brought about to move the needle\u2014my life\u2014towards somewhere I might enjoy spending the rest of my time, energy, and life force on something that means something to me, and someone out there, before we run out of time and return to the void from where we came.\\n\\nI promise that\'s not meant to sound as dark and ominous as it does.\\n\\nI see the end as the Stoics did, as something to put the rest of your life into perspective and ensure that you don\'t squander any more of life worrying about how to live than necessary, and that you stop worrying and start living.\\n\\nDo life.\\n\\nAs always thank you for reading, and thank you for rocking with me this year as I did a bunch of things for the first time.\\n\\nHappy 2024.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"pasifika-and-the-ai-opportunity","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/pasifika-and-the-ai-opportunity","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-12-13 - Pasifika-And-The-AI-Opportunity.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-13 - Pasifika-And-The-AI-Opportunity.md","title":"Pasifika And The AI Opportunity","description":"Argues AI tools can close knowledge access gap that has historically limited Pasifika education and economic advancement.

Children of aristocrats were frequently tutored by leading scholars, artists, and thinkers.\\n\\nI sat on this and thought about my experiences growing up, my environment, my schools, my circle of friends, and my parents\' friends. I looked at who was successful and who didn\'t quite come out on top.\\n\\nWhich led me to the following hypothesis:\\n\\nThe single factor, which paradoxically accounts for both the challenges and successes experienced by Pasifika, in my opinion, can be summed up in one central theme\u2014\\n\\nThe limits to this access came in many forms:\\n\\nenvironments that were hostile to learning things that would advance, and not hinder, us; whether that was at home, learning we needed to \\"play our role\\", or at school, where we were treated like we were too dumb to understand anything academically.\\n\\nTeachers who weren\'t skilled in getting through to Pasifika kids; admittedly, were already hard-up against it, given theteaching industry\'s a bit shit(pay, class sizes etc), and then the Island kids are coming to school from stressed environments, hungry, wrong uniforms, etc.\\n\\nIf we got to school at all...\\n\\nIt wasn\u2019t usually the best schools.\\n\\nNo offence to the teachers that made it to the schools I went to, but the rich schools got the best teachers, right?\\n\\nStatistically, your parents either didn\'t finish school or can\'t really help you with your English and maths homework, and hiring a tutor is only what kids in the movies did.\\n\\nSo, poor communities, with poor schools, and poor teachers don\'t lead to a rich, knowledgeable learning outcome[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Legacy Thinking\\n\\nIn the Pasifika community, they revere going to university, being a doctor, lawyer, or accountant.\\n\\nThe \\"status\\" of these professions is a big drawcard for our Pasifika parents.\\n\\nI think ofRonnie Chieng\'s stand-up, where he recalls the same pressure, but from Asian parents, and his explanation for it is that they immigrate to another country, and in one generation, in the new country, they can go from poor labourers to professionals.\\n\\nSomething that\'s not necessarily available to them in their home country, or maybe not in that time-frame?\\n\\nShare The Uncommon EngineerBut I\'ve sat and thought about what it is about these careers that makes them so impactful on our communities\u2014other than the bragging rights?\\n\\n*More money than freezing works?*\\n\\nSure.\\n\\n*Less physically taxing on our bodies?*\\n\\nYes, that too.\\n\\nThese professions require you to be deeply knowledgeable about their subjects.\\n\\nThe difference between an orderly and a doctor, even though they work at the same place, is that the doctor needs to know a lot more about anatomy than the orderly needs to know about hospital beds (no shade on orderlies).\\n\\nAnd that\'s always been, in my opinion, the thing that holds us back.\\n\\nSure, the socio-economic and environmental factors make the playing field harder, but if there was ever a shot to take, it would be at*advancing knowledge*[2](#footnote-2).\\n\\nOne important point is, when I say \\"advancing knowledge,\\" I don\'t mean a direct learn-to-earn relationship where you study for and sit a micro-credential and land a job with it.\\n\\nThere\'s nothing wrong with that.\\n\\nI mean change the way you think about the world by changing how you think about knowledge i.e. it\u2019s not an instruction manual to a paycheck.\\n\\nI remember an IT project manager at a place I was contracting at; he was a very smart guy, a bit of a smart arse if I\'m being honest, but he said something quite profound to me when I asked what he\'d studied at university.\\n\\nHe said he studied Philosophy and had a Bachelor of Arts (see why I was playing it cool with the BA jokes).\\n\\nHe said his dad had told him that you go to university to learn how to think, not to get a job.\\n\\nI thought this was brilliant!\\n\\nShareOf course, a Palagi dad had the luxury of telling his son that the student loan debt and grad job prospects were all good in exchange for learning how to think (wouldn\'t get away with that outcome in a Samoan household) because he understood the long-term good that was not going to set his son up for his first job, but for the rest of his life.\\n\\nThat\'s another form of knowledge\u2014the wisdom from our elders... another topic for another newsletter.\\n\\nThis lack of knowledge and the access to it, for whatever myriad of reasons\u2014schools, quality and skill of teachers, lack of devices, home life education levels, our social groups, etc.\u2014\\n\\nWhatever it is, we\'re missing it.\\n\\n## The Cost is More Than Any Dollar Value\\n\\nIt has cost us, and still costs us, opportunities and a better quality of life, and it\'s going to keep costing us.\\n\\nPasifika, second from the bottom in leaving school with an NCEA Level 2 or better:\\n\\nleaving school and going on to do what?\\n\\nDefinitely not tertiary study\u2026\\n\\nOk, but maybe they\'re onto bigger and better things that aren\'t school books..\\n\\nLike work:\\n\\n- Average hourly wage for Pasifika, in the top category i.e. Professionals, was $40.39NZD.\\n\\n- Average hourly wage for Palagi, in the same category i.e. Professionals, is $46.91NZD\\n\\nI\'ve already covered a lot of this ground in a piece earlier this year called\\"The Pasifika Problem & The Tech Gambit\\", but its still a bit of shock looking up the numbers again and seeing the same gap.\\n\\nMy point is, everything has a knock-on effect.\\n\\nFrom household income to owning or renting your home, to the effect on inter-generational wealth, to increased burden and pressure as the economy squeezes your low-income damp rental payments that are stretching thinner due to health-related costs...\\n\\nIt\'s like the butterfly effect, but for poverty.\\n\\nAnd it feels like there\'s always going to be this gap; we\'re always going to be behind.\\n\\nI\'m getting Pasifika to hustle the tech industry, to come in and get these salaries and skills to play in a league above, without having to delve four years deep into a \\"professional\\" career like a doctor or a lawyer.\\n\\nBut it still doesn\'t feel like it\'s going to be enough.\\n\\nUntil AI came along.\\n\\n## No Hype. Why AI?\\n\\nCertain forms of wealth and knowledge impact and change direction.\\n\\nWisdom from parents, elders, and community members who have experience.\\n\\nFor example, Mum and Dad, the ex-youth members at church, elders at church who drove taxis and picked you up from the city at 4 am.\\n\\nTutors at Uni (the free ones) who helped me with Calculus, they were doing their Masters degrees and tutoring on the side.\\n\\nMy friend Brent, when I went contracting, who is highly sought after and paid contractor, taught me the contracting game, passed on his knowledge, and advised me based on his expertise.\\n\\nEach of these stories is an example of very specific access to high-quality knowledge that was very specific to my requirements, so it was impactful to me personally but also effective in achieving the end result.\\n\\nAnd that\u2019s where I see AI opportunity - for Pasifika.\\n\\n### What Do You See?\\n\\nI see the potential of AI tools, assistants, and agents as being that for each and every Pasifika situation that has historically been under-resourced, misunderstood, and under served.\\n\\nHaving the knowledge of the world, captured in an LLM, and we\'ve been given powerful prompts and interfaces to bend and mould that to our will, means those of us with the skills and understanding can harness this power for our communities.\\n\\nAn AI \\"study buddy\\" who understands a Pasifika kid\'s unique learning style and challenges, and is able to craft their homework activities in a way that maximises learning, is literally a world-class teacher dedicated 1-on-1 with your child.\\n\\nAI agents who recruit and onboard new employees at a Pasifika ECE, help understand, generate reports, and assist with ERO reviews, and just make life easier in terms of regulation and compliance duties.\\n\\n## How?\\n\\nThe idea is there, the potential as I see it\u2014\\n\\nYes, there areplenty of things to be aware of, and we would do well to remember all those things.\\n\\nBut that said, the opportunity on the table to change the game for Pasifika in terms of access to and implementation of knowledge and learning that hasn\'t been available to us\u2014since we can\'t get into those schools, afford the tutors, or just hang out in those networks where your dad\'s friend is a professor at a uni, etc...\\n\\nWe have our ownJarvis, to teach us, to educate and learn from us, in order to better serve us, and we can build the world we need using the knowledge of the world at our fingertips.\\n\\nWe just need those of us with the tools to learn it, to step up and start building things with it.\\n\\nSounds ominous, I know (Avengers Ultron joke goes here)!\\n\\nBut this isn\'t about tearing anyone else down or conquering other people.\\n\\nIt\'s really like we\'re in the desert by ourselves, living in tents, and suddenly we\'ve got futuristic power tools from space that can dig wells in a single shot, or sustainable houses in minutes, and finding water for us.\\n\\nThe transformation happens***in***us.\\n\\nWe change how we see the opportunity, we change how we move with it.\\n\\nIt\'s like the fall of Adam; eats the fruit, finally \\"sees the truth,\\" or now has the whole knowledge.\\n\\nIt\'s meant to change us, and then we change our world.\\n\\nI\'m going to do something in the AI space.\\n\\nI don\'t know exactly what that\'s going to look like, but I\'m going to do it.\\n\\nI believe in it that much.\\n\\nI\'d be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter.\\n\\nFeel free to comment below, and maybe we can chop it up in the comments?\\n\\nThanks for reading, see you in the next one.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"new-tech-eyes-open-stay-critical-of-tech-s-shiny-new-toys","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/new-tech-eyes-open-stay-critical-of-tech-s-shiny-new-toys","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-11-29 - New-Tech-Eyes-Open-Stay-Critical-of-Techs-Shiny-New-Toys.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-29 - New-Tech-Eyes-Open-Stay-Critical-of-Techs-Shiny-New-Toys.md","title":"New Tech, Eyes Open: Stay Critical of Tech\'s Shiny New Toys","description":"Warns Pasifika against crypto NFT and blockchain grifters targeting community while exposing AI limitations with indigenous knowledge.

There was definitely a buzz.\\n\\nNFT collection names like \\"Trillionaire Thugs (TT)\\" headed up by a successful Pasifika person stood out in the local news.\\n\\nA lot of people flocked to the private Discords and Telegrams to get in on this new \\"get rich quick\\" scheme.\\n\\nTrillionaire ThugsOpenSea collectionwas created in Jan 2022.\\n\\nA video with Sam talking about the new venture can be found on YouTube, with comments concerned about the \\"floor price\\" for the TT NFT going well below the 0.3ETH floor price.\\n\\nInterview With TRILLIONAIRE THUGS NFT Founder Sam Ratumaitavuki!\\n\\nThe floor price[5](#footnote-5), as of writing this in Nov 2023, is currently 0.069ETH.\\n\\nI\'m not a financial adviser, but I\'m assuming if you bought into the 2022 hype of NFTs with TT, you\'re probably down on profit at the moment, right?\\n\\nLook, as far as I\'m concerned, this NFT thing was a fun, gimmicky \\"neopet for adults\\" type thing \u2013 nothing more.\\n\\nThe saddest thing I saw during the NFT hype was M\u0101ori artists on Instagram getting into, and promoting NFTs to their people. Not because they were taking an interest in a new technology and having some fun with the artwork, but because they were citing \\"breaking the cycle of generational wealth\\" as their reason for investing.\\n\\nMoney\'s money, whatever.\\n\\nThese folks were seeing a saviour[6](#footnote-6)in this tech, sure, partly their longing for being saved, but in no small part because of the grift hype that led them there \u2013 that\'s what was the saddest part to me.\\n\\n## The Road to Nowhere\\n\\nWhen I\u2019m thinking of the question \\"how do we tackle these grifters and scam artists?\\" I\u2019m reminded of something pretty obvious: these scammers, these con artists, are nothingnew.\\n\\nThey\'ve been around a long time, and our responses to them have been varied and evolving. Historically, it\'s been a game of cat and mouse, with law enforcement playing catch-up, leading to investigations, prosecutions, and incarcerations.\\n\\nBut it\'s pretty much an endless game of whack-a-mole in the scam world.\\n\\nSo, the emphasis shifts to \\"educating the end user\\" as a key strategy in minimising damage.\\n\\nI was going to talk about how to mitigate harms in the tech, with technical solutions like authentication and authorisation- and we all know I could go on forever about technological things.\\n\\nBut this piece is really about the human side of the equation when faced with techs shiny new toys (admittedly, probably more the marketing hype).\\n\\nThe human element includes those who are either outright grifters or narcissists, attracted to the tech scene but lacking the commitment to truly understand the technology, its benefits, and its drawbacks.\\n\\nThen there are the well-intentioned but uninformed individuals, who end up being agents of chaos preaching crypto and blockchain at the wrong audience.\\n\\nThis brings us to an essential point: we need Pasifika Tech Role models- likeKelsey Hightower, andAngie Jonesare for the black community, orMicheal Running Wolfis for Native Americans.\\n\\nTechnical, Compassionate, Experienced, and diverse.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI don\u2019t really have a definitive conclusion.\\n\\nI know this was a lot of ranting, mixed with anecdotes and some specific points.\\n\\nIf \u201cawareness\u201d and a call to wake the f*** up was my intended conclusion, I\u2019d be happy with that.\\n\\nMore Tech Role Models, though?\\n\\nSure, it\'s not a silver bullet, single-threaded solution type problem, but in my humble opinion, the more Hightowers, Joneses, and Running Wolves there are in our community, the richer the discourse will be.\\n\\nEven in disagreements, these figures will absolutely drop gems left and right, enriching our communities with high-level knowledge.\\n\\nThat\'s a sight better than the fast, gimmicky, slick-talking language of grift.\\n\\nThanks for reading, see you in the next one.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"pasifika-need-tech-leaders-who-technical","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/pasifika-need-tech-leaders-who-technical","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-11-14 - Pasifika-Need-Tech-Leaders-Who-Are-Technical.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-14 - Pasifika-Need-Tech-Leaders-Who-Are-Technical.md","title":"Pasifika Need Tech Leaders Who Are Technical.","description":"Argues Pasifika need CTO-level technical leaders not salespeople to prevent vendor exploitation of community technology projects.

Getting more \\"Pasifika into technology,\\" a purely numbers game for bums on tech seats, OR\\n\\n1. Getting Pasifika a*\\"Seat at the table,\\"*a long-tail strategy with organisations going after leadership power.\\n\\nWhile these two things are important, I\'m cognisant of a couple of things I\'ve already seen happen.\\n\\nFirstly, with the bum-rush of getting as many Pasifika hoisted over the fence into tech as possible, I\'ve seen the casualties of the folks who could\'ve been successful in transitioning had they been given the necessary support to succeed.\\n\\nI\'m seeing a new*\\"factory floor\\"*for Pasifika to get trapped in the tech industry, taking up the lower-skilled, lower-paid jobs that are cheaper to use Pasifika for than paying for LLM\'s on cloud.\\n\\nSecondly, from the few Pasifika organisations I\'ve seen make a play for being the spokespeople for Pasifika issues at the technology table, I\'m loath to say I find some of the things I know about these organisations\u2026 unsettling?\\n\\nBar a small few, I don\'t have a lot of trust in the motivations of some of the forerunners in this space to be advocates for true technical leadership that will benefit Pasifika (more so than the organisation\'s brand power).\\n\\nBut we can\'t make everyone happy all the time, and something is better than nothing, I guess?\\n\\nAnyway, back to the essay at hand.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Need for Executive-Level Expertise\\n\\nThe technical leadership I\'m talking about is akin to the executive level CTO, where technical expertise meets business acumen, or at the very least, organisational/corporate experience.\\n\\nAdd to that a deep understanding of Pasifika culture, goals, and objectives, and we\'re most of the way there.\\n\\nWhat does it look like when this*\\"layer,\\"*this high-level*\\"interfacing function,\\"*is missing?\\n\\nI have the unfortunate[1](#footnote-1)pleasure of being the person at the coal face of this phenomenon because I get approached to help out in these situations.\\n\\n## Real-Life Example: Local Government Group\'s Struggle\\n\\nThis is one real-world example, but in fairness, a lot of them are like this:\\n\\nA Pasifika group will set about trying to build a platform or an app for community use.\\n\\nThey approach a tech solution provider, i.e., a vendor, they work with them and come out with something they believe is pretty standard.\\n\\nThe problem is the community group doesn\'t really have a point of reference.\\n\\nWhen I\'ve been brought in, sat in a few meetings, and checked out the project plans, I soon realise the vendor lacks any real knowledge of the Pasifika community\'s real needs, hasn\'t asked the right questions, and unsurprisingly is delivering an over-engineered and overpriced solution.\\n\\nThe result is a platform too complicated and costly for the community to operate.\\n\\nI came in near the end of Phase 1, and the community group was still going to go ahead with Phase 2, at twice the budget of Phase 1, because they had resigned themselves to the fact this was just \\"how it goes.\\"\\n\\nRight?\\n\\nNo. Wrong.\\n\\n## The Importance of Technical and Project Understanding\u2026\\n\\nThe thing that annoys me about this story is that the vendor, by many tech solution project standards, had done a piss-poor job of really understanding the customer\'s challenges and designing a suitable solution. A big part of the process is \\"gathering requirements.\\"\\n\\nSo that\'s on the vendor, but the community group would have been none the wiser because how would they know?\\n\\nI see and hear of at least a couple of these scenarios every year, and I\'m not even listening out for them, so imagine how prevalent this is across the Pasifika community given everything\'s being pushed into technology.\\n\\nWhich is why I identify and kind of bang on about the need for this specific expertise\u2014this level and function to integrate between two worlds: Pasifika and Technology.\\n\\n## Technical Leadership is not Sales and Management\u2026\\n\\nSo I say, what we need are***genuine***technical leaders, not salespeople, not people leaders, or marketing personnel (no shade to these folks).\\n\\nIn my experience, those with deep technical knowledge and understanding prove to be more effective leaders at this intersection because there\'s something (IMHO) undeniable about having a deep understanding of technology to direct and colour your perspective of the challenges in front of you.\\n\\nAnd this view isn\'t even Pasifika specific; it\'s one I believe in for any tech organisation.\\n\\nYes, Marketing, Sales, all of those functions can be 10x with some technical understanding.\\n\\nIt\'s why I\'ve seen Account Managers here at AWS trying to get their Solution Architect Associate studies on; they\'ve seen the Solution Architects (SA) at work in front of the customer and can see the difference in delivery from the SA and trust coming from the customer.\\n\\n## The Consequences of Inadequate Leadership\\n\\nAgain this seems like a no-brainer, but let\u2019s be explicit about things:\\n\\nIf we lack this technical leadership, this will only lead to**exploitation**.\\n\\nWhether that\'s from ignorance or malice by a vendor, either way, it spells more disadvantage for an already marginalised group.\\n\\n## The Long-Term Solution: Focusing on Engineering Expertise\\n\\nIf you\u2019re starting to see a pattern here, it\u2019s because I\u2019m really trying to hone in on this concept of \u201ctechnical expertise\u201d being a key value in the \u201ctechnology\u201d industry[2](#footnote-2)\\n\\nThere\'s no short and easy pathway to the solution I see, which is a focus on developing senior to principal level engineering and architectural expertise within the Pasifika community.\\n\\nThis, to me, is (again) a no-brainer, and I guess I\'m writing this whole piece about it because there are people in my community who either don\'t know or believe it\'s something else, and I think that\'s a distraction and, quite frankly, a risk to the best long-term outcome.\\n\\nTechnical Leadership isn\'t just vibes\u2014yes, vibes are important, all the intangibles are important, culture, mental health, all health really... where I feel I need to draw a line in the sand, is when it\'s an \\"either-or\\" and not a hard**AND**.\\n\\nVibes***AND***solid technical skills and expertise.\\n\\nI can\'t stress enough how much I believe this approach will provide the necessary technical guidance for Pasifika initiatives and projects in our community.\\n\\nWe should be focused on this and creating environments, officially or unofficially, that nurture and support engineering, leadership skills, and understanding within the community.\\n\\n## Pfft, What Do I Know?\\n\\nAs someone who has navigated the tech industry successfully and has applied my own technical leadership to various Pasifika-led technology projects, I truly believe this is the way forward\u2014at least for this part of the puzzle.\\n\\nI don\'t proclaim to know how the rest of the \\"Pasifika progress\\" challenges go, but for technology, I think I can say this much.\\n\\nMy own contributions to this utopia of engineering-positive Pasifika environments are through various channels: I have this newsletter you are currently reading, a charity that runs tech workshops and code clubs for Pasifika students in schools, a Pasifika Tech Network social group, and a YouTube Live Stream for technical knowledge sharing with a Pasifika face on it.\\n\\n## What Can People Do to Help?\\n\\nSo, what\'s the call to action here?\\n\\nIf you find value in these ideas, talk about them with others. Recommend the newsletter or YouTube stream, and bring these topics into your everyday conversations. Your support in raising awareness is crucial.\\n\\nShare The Uncommon EngineerThanks for reading, see you in the next one.\\n\\nia manuia,\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"going-monthly-plan-that-didn-t-go-at-all","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/going-monthly-plan-that-didn-t-go-at-all","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-10-31 - The-Going-Monthly-Plan-That-Didnt-Go-at-All.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-31 - The-Going-Monthly-Plan-That-Didnt-Go-at-All.md","title":"The \u201cGoing Monthly\u201d Plan That Didn\u2019t Go at All.","description":"Returns from newsletter hiatus reflecting on focus struggles and launches paid subscriptions to commit seriously to writing.

And at the same time I think I can add more context to the story or the subject because I believe the information coming to mind would be really useful to better understand the story.\\n\\nI usually have several things on my mind, and to be honest there\u2019s no rhyme or reason for why it jumps from one thing to the next, it\u2019s just whatever was in the queue gets dumped out and then I\u2019m off on that tangent.\\n\\nAgain, no, I don\'t have ADHD.\\n\\nWhat I do have are too many things I want to focus on and develop, but I end up being overwhelmed by it all and then do nothing.\\n\\nTo be honest, I thought it was normal to want to pursue lots of different things all the time. I believed that people who excelled at a single thing (like actors, musicians, or academics) had to make the very sad decision along the way to beboringsingle-focused on that thing, effectively sacrificing parts of themselves so that one part could be great.\\n\\nI don\u2019t think it\'s really like that for those folks.\\n\\nI have two younger brothers, both artists (one in the performing arts, the other in painting, tattooing, design, and music), and they\u2019ve only ever been super interested in their specific vocations. Sure, they have other interests. One of them is a bit of a motorcycle junkie, bought and (attempted to) rebuild a bike, took a course on being a bike mechanic, and is part of a motorcycle club (no, not a gang; they\'re mostly middle-aged actors with fancy vintage bikes), but he\u2019s an actor through and through.\\n\\nAnd has been for decades.\\n\\nI\u2019m not 100% sure why I\u2019m using that brother as an example. Suffice it to say, I know people can be great and focus on a single thing without losing their interests and spending time on other things.\\n\\nThe problem is, with multiple interests and passions, not being able to prioritise among all your interests will leave you living a \u201cmile wide at an inch deep.\u201d\\n\\nWhich is fine for some people, but speaking for myself, the deep dives into topics, the long-form articles, and conversations about subjects that fascinate me are what I\u2019m after. It\u2019s what I find tremendous value in\u2014just experiencing the depth of something\u2019s beauty, wisdom, or peace. Think about talking to a monk or the Dalai Lama\u2014just an innate peace that has been plumbed through the drudgery and reality of the human experience, to find that insight and enlightenment.\\n\\nIn short, I like that deep sh*t.\\n\\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s worth having. That\u2019s what\u2019s worth working towards.\\n\\nAnd I guess that\u2019s what\u2019s ultimately worth focusing on. But I don\u2019t have unlimited time and energy for diving deep into everything.\\n\\nHow do we choose what gets focus and what gets relegated to a lowernicevalue?\\n\\n## Your Biggest Enemy and Ally Is: You\\n\\nSure, that\'s some $2-dollar-shop psychologist clich\xe9 right there, but things are clich\xe9 for a reason, right?\\n\\nIf \\"A mile wide and an inch deep\\" is how I don\'t want to live, the alternative is obviously an \\"inch wide and a mile deep.\\"\\n\\nFocus is easier said than done, and prioritising is an activity for people who know who they are and what\'s important to them, so the task at that point is executive, not cognitive in nature.\\n\\nIn other words, the order is obvious or already decided; there\'s only moving things into place.\\n\\nI\'m not here to guru anyone into productivity or \\"who am I?\\" solutions. I\'ve long found that the \\"answers\\" have been available and understood for a while. But if you can\'t execute them or abide by them consistently, then that\'s your problem.\\n\\nFor me, I had to take inventory of all the things I was trying to do\u2014this newsletter, for example.\\n\\nWhat am I really trying to do here?\\n\\nWhat do I want from this?\\n\\nAnd the answer to that is to write.\\n\\nI want to write things out of my head and into the real world, organise them, look at the words on paper, and package them in a way that can offer profound insight (the confidence aye lol).\\n\\nThat\'s it.\\n\\nBut this is up against a myriad of other things: a full-time job that pays my bills, a BJJ and gym routine that require time and consistency, and also cost me in terms of energy available for other tasks. I have a newborn baby and a stack of books I want to read. In the middle of it all, I have a household and a wife in the mix (sorry, honey, I promise I\'m not listing in order of priority), and apparently, to make the most of all this and deliver my best, I\'m meant to find time to sleep.\\n\\nThe truth of the matter is quite simple- this is all as complicated or as simple as we want to make it.\\n\\nI\'m not going to die if my hope of gracing another R&V main stage to play the drums in front of thousands of people is not fulfilled again.\\n\\nOr if I don\'t win another professional MMA fight, or if I only read 3 books this year instead of the 12 I promised myself I would.\\n\\nThere is no \\"solution\\" here other than stepping back from it all and knowing this: this is the process of refining what we\'ve made of life to this point. I\'m sure the hustle bros will disagree with me, but everyone, at some point, has made their decision on the things they want in life\u2014whether it\'s truly their goals or their parents\' or society\'s\u2014and the next important decision is whether they\'re willing to do what it takes to achieve it.\\n\\nAnd that\'s the part we live with most days.\\n\\nAm I going to do the thing I know I need to do to live the life I want? Or not?\\n\\nOr am I going to change the things I want in life to match the things I\'m willing to do?\\n\\nThere\'s no right or wrong answer, only the realisation that this malleable and tormenting reality, this constant question of\u2014\\n\\n\\"Is this what I want to do with my life?\\"\\n\\n\u2014will remain until we have an answer for it.\\n\\n## It\u2019s Not You, It\u2019s Me.\\n\\nIt\'s not all doom and gloom\u2014today\u2019s newsletter wasn\'t meant to be a dark question mark over your life and life\'s purpose, I promise.\\n\\nIt\'s just something that\'s, for the most part, compulsive for me\u2014to find myself questioning what I\'m doing and if it\'s still what I want to do.\\n\\nI think it can be helpful to reflect as you live through your life and see if the path you\'re travelling is still the path you want to be on.\\n\\nAfter all, the world is constantly changing, and most importantly, you, the person, are (hopefully) always learning and growing as well. So naturally, you won\'t be the same person you were when you started out on the road you\'re on now.\\n\\n## How Can We Support the Uncommon Engineer?\\n\\nOh, I\u2019m so glad you asked \ud83d\ude01.\\n\\nI\'ve enabled paid subscriptions.\\n\\nI\'ve been thinking about it for a while but was always hesitant to take this endeavour \\"too seriously,\\" essentially giving myself an out, instead of trying to see what I could make of it.\\n\\nBut I\'ve received some really great and completely unsolicited encouragement from people at work about past newsletters, so I know there\'s something here.\\n\\nOne of those work colleagues even pledged $150 USD to the newsletter when payments were still disabled just because he really believed in what I was writing about (Thanks, Cam).\\n\\nDeep down, I know I have knowledge and insights worth writing about, ideas worth spreading, and topics worth discussing with society at large.\\n\\nWith that comes what I\'m offering\u2014\\n\\n### Free Subscribers\\n\\n- I will post at least one free newsletter a month that everyone can read.\\n\\n### Paid Subscribers\\n\\n- All paid-only posts including deep dives and rants[2](#footnote-2)\\n\\n- Full access to posts archive\\n\\n- Podcast - I\u2019m toying with the idea of a recording of each newsletter so you can hear it in my voice[3](#footnote-3)but want to probably license my voice before the LLMs get it and then all manner of shenanigans are committed in my likeness.\\n\\nThe newsletter will still stay very much in the technology space (it\u2019s kind of my niche).\\n\\nSo, the deep dives will be on tech topics like cloud platforms, AI, cyber security, but also their impacts on the Pacific Islands or the Pasifika community and how tech can enable or disrupt things related to my community and how we should navigate accordingly.\\n\\nWhere it makes sense for a wider audience to access my writing, I\'ll make it public.\\n\\nBut for the most part, these are insights and perspectives that I believe are worth the $8 USD/month subscription.\\n\\nAnd if your workplace covers subscriptions, this newsletter can serve as a valuable learning resource on technology. \ud83d\ude09[4](#footnote-4)\\n\\nThat\u2019s it.\\n\\nIt\u2019s good to be back.\\n\\nI still have a love-hate relationship with starting out writing each newsletter, but I think after a few drafts and leaving it to sit, it\u2019s nice to come back and see that it wasn\u2019t all complete gibberish.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading- see you in the next one.*\\n\\n*R.*"},{"id":"the-newsletter-is-going-monthly","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-newsletter-is-going-monthly","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-07-25 - The-Newsletter-Is-Going-Monthly.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-25 - The-Newsletter-Is-Going-Monthly.md","title":"The Newsletter Is Going Monthly","description":"Announces shift from weekly to monthly newsletter to prioritize technical building projects over writing discipline.

When I asked them how many mentors were M\u0101ori & Pasifika, they said they were having trouble finding any.\\n\\nIf you already know how this goes from this point on, you can skip ahead.\\n\\nI met some graduates from this course, who are Pasifika, and I\'m not surprised when they tell me the people running the course lacked any cultural awareness and safety for the M\u0101ori & Pasifika students who went through it.\\n\\nSome of them stayed on as tutors to shield the next cohort from the same experience.\\n\\nThis clich\xe9 story of people who don\'t know what they\'re doing, getting funded, to \\"help\\" people the funding is targeted to, yet don\'t know anyone from that community, is so boring it\u2019s tiring.\\n\\nCan we get a better villain please? We\u2019ve already seen this one.\\n\\nIt\'s like when people know I work in IT and ask me to fix their printers (bad analogy incoming).\\n\\nSure, we can watch me fumble around and button-mash the thing, trying to look up the manual online to figure it out.\\n\\nBut is that the kind of printer-fixing service you\'re looking for?\\n\\nThe person who comes in with some relative knowledge, poking around on your time and patience, and eventually, maybe fixes it?\\n\\nNo?\\n\\nThen why is the \\"close enough\\" service good enough for M\u0101ori and Pasifika?\\n\\nI can\u2019t do much about the opportunists - they\u2019re going to do what they\u2019re going to do.\\n\\nWhat I can do instead is focus on things within our \u201ccircle of influence\u201d, and that is to understand everything we need to know about the tech industry opportunity.\\n\\nThe good, the bad, the middle management.\\n\\nI know Pasifika are between a rock and a hard place because we need to move away from these \\"sunsetting\\" industries, but how much do we really know about working in tech?\\n\\nThe current generation of Pasifika being sold the \\"working in Technology\\" dream aren\'t being told the whole truth[2](#footnote-2).\\n\\nWe know about the salaries and bonuses[3](#footnote-3), the work-from-home setups, and remote work opportunities.\\n\\nWe know we can teach ourselves all the tech we need to know on the internet if we know where to look and how to learn.\\n\\nBut what about what\'s not great about tech?\\n\\nDo you know one of the most important questions you can ask any future employer during an interview?\\n\\n*\\"What\'s the most challenging part of the role?\\"*\\n\\nYou want to know what things are like on a bad day.\\n\\nWorking in tech isn\'t for everyone.\\n\\nI don\'t mean that in a \\"gatekeeper-y\\" way.\\n\\nIt\'s a fundamental law of the universe\u2014 not everyone is going to like everything.\\n\\nYou can choose to work in tech for a number of reasons, just know what the deal is and what it\'s going to cost.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re a geek and would play with tech even if you never got paid for it this may be easier for you.\\n\\nThe danger for you here is your passion being exploited for free labour because you\'re so obsessed with figuring something out that you lose your evenings and weekends working on solving the puzzle.\\n\\nHowever, if you lack that genuine interest or passion for tech, like with any career, it can lead to dissatisfaction and burnout in the long run.\\n\\nIt\'s challenging to stay motivated and get ahead in a field that requires continuous learning and adapting.\\n\\nFor all the work-from-home and \\"flexible work\\" talk around tech\u2014which may seem like jazzy caf\xe9s working on your laptop sipping flat whites\u2014the tech industry is known for long working hours, high stress levels, and demanding work environments.\\n\\nIf your life already has several personal challenges and stressors, entering a potentially high-intensity field is going to add to that stress.\\n\\nAnd lastly, if this wasn\'t already obvious to you, you\'re going to be one of the only Pasifika people in your team, maybe even the department.\\n\\nAnd if you\'re a Pasifika woman in tech... good luck.\\n\\nIt\'s getting better (I think?) with more representation, but this is the current reality.\\n\\nSure, it\'s good to mix in with everyone else, but I bet if we made everyone else hang around with zero people who looked like them for most of their working life, they\'d feel some type of way about it as well.\\n\\nIt\'s not fatal.\\n\\nIt\'s just a factor you need to be aware of when chasing the tech opportunity as a Pasifika person.\\n\\nAgain, this isn\'t \\"don\'t come to tech if you identify with any of these,\\" it\'s \\"be aware of these issues as you make a decision that\'s best for you.\\"\\n\\nFor all my long-windedpontificationon the subject, I don\'t have any perfect solutions for how to fix any of this. I have just two pieces of advice that have helped me and might help you navigate this journey.\\n\\nFirstly, \\"shared culture\\" - try to find a network like the \u201cPasifika Tech Network\u201d to join and participate in. You\'ll see there are more of us out here; we just need to find and support each other.\\n\\nAnd not to hide ourselves away in a segregated corner of the internet, but to grow and encourage our community in a way that makes it easier for us to participate and contribute to an industry we genuinely want to be a part of.\\n\\nSecondly, \\"shared passion\\" - one thing that a role model of mine,Kelsey Hightower, touched on in a podcast, and that I\'ve experienced myself[4](#footnote-4), is this phenomenon where when people come together around a shared passion, something they geek out over, they stop seeing the differences for a second and just see the other geek who\'s into this stuff too.\\n\\nI think in both cases, it\'s a space that lets us see each other\'s humanity instead of our differences.\\n\\nAnd it\'s nice to just feel like part of the group doing things together, and everything\'s okay.\\n\\nThanks for reading - see you in the next one.\\n\\nShare*If you genuinely found this post interesting, please give it a \u2764\ufe0f to let me know \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd*\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m actively studying or learning this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Working on a bunch of AWS Workshops\u2026\\n\\n### Building\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m building or working on this week\u2026*\\n\\n- A YouTube Channel\u2026 watch this space.\\n\\n- Generative AI with Large Language Modelsthis bored me to tears, so I stopped.\\n\\n### Interesting Reads\\n\\n*Articles or other writing that stood out to me this week\u2026*\\n\\n- N/A \u2026 need to reinstate my reading schedule.\\n\\n### Community\\n\\n*Other projects in community I\u2019m working on\u2026*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Education Charity-*Providing Tech Learning Opportunities for the Pasifika Community.*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Network-*A Network for Pasifika Tech Professionals & Learners.*"},{"id":"staying-technical-architect-engineer","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/staying-technical-architect-engineer","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-07-11 - Staying-Technical-The-Architect-and-the-Engineer.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-11 - Staying-Technical-The-Architect-and-the-Engineer.md","title":"Staying Technical: The Architect and the Engineer.","description":"Argues architects must stay hands-on technical to build empathy and understanding through lived experience not just theory.

I thought several roles in many organisations were also bullshit.\\n\\nMy point is the significance of the relationship between the technologist and the technology.\\n\\nWhen someone is a certain distance away from the hands-on building of the software or the system, their perspective and experience is also that far removed from the details of the system.\\n\\nYou could get into a few theoretical and philosophical discussions about it, but how much do you really know about a solution if you\'ve never built it?[2](#footnote-2)\\n\\nThere\'s a big difference between following your finger on a map and hiking the trail from that map, in saying you know how to get from A to B.\\n\\nWhen you\'ve been through something yourself, it\'s different.\\n\\nYou\'ve felt it in your bones.\\n\\nYou know how long the machines actually take to start up. You know the pain of software compile times and tests that run for ages and then fail. You know the real pain of a command output saying your script has an error but can\'t tell you which line it\'s on, and you find out it was just a f****ng indentation issue.\\n\\nI fired up an AWS Managed AD instance last night.\\n\\nThe instructions said \\"this will take 20-40 mins to start\\", which is a very different expectation from knowing I can fire up most EC2 instances in minutes.\\n\\nBut now I know, because I\'ve been there, done the thing, and bought the t-shirt.\\n\\nThere\'s a connection to the experience of doing something that lends the doer an understanding you can maybe extrapolate into words. Someone else might intellectually understand what it\'s like from reading those words, but they won\'t ever get the full picture, the immersive full-body experience you get when you do the thing yourself.\\n\\nThere\'s this other thing that happens as well.\\n\\nWhen you do a thing and have a lived experience of the thing, just like gaining a new in-game treasure - you gain empathy.\\n\\nEmpathy is that deep \\"knowing\\" of the thing, so that when you see others going through it, or know they might go through a thing you\'ve been through, you see it through a lens of understanding, not judgement.\\n\\nCharity\'s article was less about trashing Architects and more about pointing out the understanding that exists for those folks who \\"do the thing\\", build the software and systems.\\n\\nThis is why I believe as an Architect, you stay hands-on, you stay technical because it builds the empathy that connects you to the people you\'re trying to convince to use this technology.\\n\\nThe same way learning a language, or living in a different country, builds this empathy and understanding between things.\\n\\nIt builds connection.\\n\\nSo, I stay technical. It\'s not easy - nothing worth having is, right?\\n\\nA role like Solution Architect is customer-facing. It deals with not only technical subjects but also understanding business development, sales, marketing, and more human-related dynamics than, say, a software or DevOps engineer.\\n\\nStudying for certifications and doing hands-on labs wherever I can helps.\\n\\nIt also helps that AWS requires and encourages ongoing study, training, and certifications as a part of my role.\\n\\nHaving adigital gardenfor documentation and technical write-ups, and aGitHubwith a bunch of unfinished projects, also motivates me to work on things. But at the end of the day, you really have to figure out how to sit down and learn stuff.\\n\\nI set up a whole-ass Twitchstreamas a productivity hack for studying for my OSCP.\\n\\nI believe staying hands-on technical makes for the best Architects. Also, because I\'m a geek, I just like learning and being good at computers.\\n\\nSo, go out there, get your hands dirty, feel some pain, learn a few things and connect with your inner computer geek.\\n\\nThanks for reading - see you in the next one.\\n\\nShare*If you genuinely found this post interesting, please give it a \u2764\ufe0f to let me know \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd*\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m actively studying or learning this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Toss up between Solution Architecture Pro Study, or CKS re-certify study.\\n\\n### Building\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m building or working on this week\u2026*\\n\\n- AWS Managed Microsoft AD- hands-on workshop labs.\\n\\n- A small Golang Microservices Demo\\n\\n### Interesting Reads\\n\\n*Articles or other writing that stood out to me this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Nothing much read this past week.\\n\\n### Community\\n\\n*Other projects in community I\u2019m working on\u2026*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Education Charity-*Providing Tech Learning Opportunities for the Pasifika Community.*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Network-*A Network for Pasifika Tech Professionals & Learners.*"},{"id":"brief-history-of-career-burnout-me","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/brief-history-of-career-burnout-me","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-07-05 - A-Brief-History-of-Career-Burnout-Me.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-05 - A-Brief-History-of-Career-Burnout-Me.md","title":"A Brief History of Career Burnout & Me","description":"Examines burnout from tech demands plus cultural taxation of being sole Pasifika representing community to company and vice versa.

But when you add international travel, visa issues, security transportation, domestic flight cancellations, and recovery from a cold, you\'ve got a situation you don\'t want to be in too often.\\n\\nIt\'s tough.\\n\\nBut it\u2019s the work.\\n\\nThe problem with the work, as it stands, is sustainability.\\n\\nAnd,the way our account is set up, we need[1](#footnote-1)senior-level technical people who are Pasifika, to go into the Pacific to do this work because we understand that experience and cultural understanding is key to getting positive outcomes in this space.\\n\\nThe pool of people with the necessary technical skills and experience, who are also from the Pacific diaspora, is not large.\\n\\nAnd the work that needs doing is not small.\\n\\nBurnout is nothing new in the tech sector, and it\'s certainly not new in my career and experience.\\n\\nIn fact, I wrote a blog post about this same phenomenon back in2018.\\n\\nWhen I wrote about it then, I was contracting. I had pressure on a professional and personal level - usual career stuff, right?\\n\\nDeadlines, navigating company culture, bad management, legacy infrastructure, unrealistic project requirements, and generally keeping up with tech that\u2019s constantly evolving and being marketed to the decision-makers.\\n\\nWhen you\u2019re as much of a geek as I am, obsessed with technology, learning about it, building it, watching videos, and talking about it with other geeks, you don\u2019t tend to pay too much attention to the fact that you\u2019re the only Pasifika person in the team, the department, sometimes the entire organization.\\n\\nLike, you know it as an objective fact, but what are you going to do?\\n\\nShareTech is a fast-paced industry, and we\u2019re constantly learning to keep up with everything, so this pressure is a given - for everyone in this industry.\\n\\nWorking in a big corporate organization comes with its own peculiarities: organizational politics, a big hotbed of personalities, work behaviors, backgrounds, and navigating that with performance pressure is also a given - for everyone.\\n\\nI\u2019m not oblivious to the reality of corporate life as an obvious \u201cminority\u201d - you\u2019re the odd one out, no one really gets you, you have to do the work to assimilate into everyone else\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d - I\u2019ve always just accepted it as the price of admission to these spaces - it is what it is.\\n\\nLike, do you really think I say \u201cg\u2019day mate, how\'s things? Me? Nah, can\u2019t complain... Bob\u2019s your uncle, something about the weather, etc.,\u201d or anything like that to my brothers and people in my community? \ud83d\ude02\\n\\nI\u2019ve always known about the concept of a \u201ccultural tax\u201d paid by under-represented groups. I thought it mainly referred to the ad-hoc education you had to provide to people to not saystupid shitculturally insensitive things.\\n\\nIt wasn\u2019t until I started doing community work, running code clubs for Pasifika kids in primary schools, that I really had to face a type of pressure or stress that I always knew was there but managed to avoid confronting in its full form.\\n\\nRepresentation, when it\'s just you trying not to be treated like the \u201cdiversity hire\u201d, and you don\'t want to embarrass yourself professionally or let your family down, is one thing.\\n\\nRepresentation when you\u2019re advocating specifically for an organisation not to marginalise, not just you, but everyone like you, and you start feeling the weight of that responsibility for your people, is another type of pressure altogether.\\n\\nNow that I\u2019m one of the few Pasifika at a big tech company, but also in a role that is specifically focused on the Pacific Islands, I\u2019m not only representing the company as a Pasifika person to the Pacific Islands but also representing Pasifika culture, values, and experience to the company on behalf of myself and as a pseudo representative of the Pacific Islands - does that make sense?\\n\\nFor the record, I was born in New Zealand and only spent my pre-school years in Samoa before growing up here. I speak, read, and understand my language and know most of the values, traditions, and protocols that go with my culture.\\n\\nBut this circles back to my earlier point - we don\u2019t have a lot of options to choose from to do this work.\\n\\nThere\'s a lot of work to do, and only a few of us to do it.\\n\\nAnd while we\'re trying to do our day jobs, we\'re also doing this, which Cecil Canton neatly describes in his articleThe \u201ccultural taxation\u201d of faculty of color in the Academy:\\n\\n*He defined \u201ccultural taxation\u201d as the obligation to show good citizenship towards the institution by serving its needs for ethnic representation on committees, or to demonstrate knowledge and commitment to a cultural group, which, though it may bring accolades to the institution, is not usually rewarded by the institution on whose behalf the service was performed.*\\n\\nI\'ve been added to groups and meetings that have nothing to do with tech, and everything to do with \'Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\', and I don\u2019t think I can add much value because it\u2019s not my area of expertise (or interest, to be honest).\\n\\nI get linked up with M\u0101ori organisations, which is fine - I always have mean k\u014drero\u2019s with the cuzzies - but in my opinion, you\'re shortchanging these folks because I\'m Pasifika and M\u0101ori are M\u0101ori.\\n\\nNone of this work (above) was directly related to my role or performance metrics.\\n\\nSure, we all do things here and there that aren\'t strictly part of our roles, but whole committees, recurring meetings, and monthly catch-ups are not it.\\n\\nShareTaika Waititi recently expressed this hilariously in aspeech at a luncheonwhere he said:\\n\\n*\u201cAll of us wanna be working and not having to come and do f***ing panels and speeches in the middle of our day. This is a great thing. It\u2019s good that we\u2019re talking about it. We have to keep talking about it but this is the s*** you\u2019ve got us doing.\u201d*\\n\\nAnd here\u2019s \u201cthe rub\u201d\u2026\\n\\nIn and of itself (and like Taika) I think this is good work to do - so this is not a complaint that this work shouldn\u2019t exist.\\n\\nI do think it\u2019s well-meaning.\\n\\nIt\'s helping to bring awareness and education, and working to be more inclusive.\\n\\nThat\'s a good thing, right?\\n\\nBut what is this edition about again?\\n\\nOh yeah - burnout.\\n\\nI can\'t speak for anyone else, but I think if anything, my burnout comes from having so few hands to cover so much work, the added layer of organisational cultural tax, and then personally wanting the \'good work\' to still be done and done properly, which might mean a compromise somewhere.\\n\\nI actually started a discussion thread in thePasifika Tech NetworkDiscord, asking who had experienced burnout, and unsurprisingly, a lot of Pasifika tech folks have felt it. All of them had some great tips on how they managed it, which was awesome to see.\\n\\nThe standard advice of drawing healthy work boundaries for yourself and asking for help when you need to, still apply - for everyone.\\n\\nBut I don\u2019t have any answers for dealing with this extra layer of stress and pressure that is not-being-part-of-the-dominant-culture.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re fortunate enough like me to have good work mates and a manager you can talk to, use your powers of communication to let them know where you\u2019re at, it might not solve all your problems, but it helps to know you have people who care enough to be uncomfortable and \u201cyea, I don\u2019t know the answer to this\u201d with you.\\n\\nThanks for reading - see you in the next one.\\n\\nShare*If you genuinely found this post interesting, please give it a \u2764\ufe0f to let me know \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd*\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m actively studying or learning this week\u2026*\\n\\n- \u2018AWS Certified Security - Speciality\u2019- Sat Exam.

Research shows that it takes about8 days to fully wind downand actually be on a \\"break.\\"\\n\\nIt\'s a particularly busy period at work at the moment, different from other times of busyness in my career as an engineer.\\n\\nAs a solution architect, I move in a fluid space between customer interfacing engagement to work out the technical, organisational, and often economic and political challenges. And the technical and sometimes not-so-technical solutions that best help the customer solve their challenges.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nLife was a lot simpler earlier in my career as a systems or DevOps engineer because I worked for*one*company, had*specific*requirements in*specific*areas, and had a*limited*set of solutions to choose from. It\'s funny thinking back on the concept of*\\"scope creep\\"*now because when this happens during a project, it becomes a source of stress for engineers. Even with my limited math skills, I understood that more variables equals more ways for this to go wrong.\\n\\nAnd that causes stress.\\n\\nEven though the landscape at a senior level of my tech career is quite different from my earlier engineering roles, the potential for stress remains the same.\\n\\nI\'m sure motivated and ambitious people already feel pressure to achieve and for tech people, it\'s also about not looking or sounding stupid because there\u2019s a lot of smart folks in tech.\\n\\nBut this pressure can often lead to making sub-optimal short-term decisions. These decisions are not great in the long term, and as they accumulate, so does the stress. You end up taking on more than you can reasonably expect to manage in a workday, and then it spills over into the rest of your life.\\n\\nIf you stretch yourself like this for long enough, it leads to a spiral. At first, it may not be super dramatic, but everything slowly gets pulled into a big arc, like a whirlpool. Regular gym sessions start getting cut short and eventually missed altogether. Coffee catch-ups with family and friends get pushed aside, and you end up not catching up with them for long periods of time. 6pm work finishes turn into \\"checking in on things\\" after dinner at 8pm.\\n\\nYour sleep suffers, you become more irritable because you haven\'t worked out in a while, and your mood makes it even harder to deal with the new work stresses. Even if you think you\'re performing at the level you were before, it\'s definitely costing you more in energy and willpower.\\n\\nAnd why do we do this?\\n\\nWhy don\'t we set healthy boundaries around work and commit to energy-replenishing activities and practices that enable us to live a healthier and more sustainable life?\\n\\nIt seems like such an obvious thing for us to do.\\n\\n*Is it because we\u2019re scared we might get fired if we don\'t take on all the extra work?*\\n\\nMaybe, but that\'s not it.\\n\\n*Is it because this is actually how you grow, and pressure makes diamonds, and all that \u201chustle-nomics\u201d?*\\n\\nSure, a bit of struggle towards goals is a path for personal and professional growth, but this ain\'t it.\\n\\n*Maybe it\'s really because you\'re scared you\'re not good enough, and that if you don\'t push yourself to earn your place at work, your value as a person and member of society diminishes along with it?*\\n\\nYeah, maybe that\'s it.\\n\\nIs imposter syndrome really just a lack of self-confidence and the self-fulfilling behaviour that follows, creating an environment around you that confirms your already prejudiced belief that you\'re not good enough?\\n\\nMaybe that\'s the reason you can\'t stand up to your boss and say,*\\"you know what, these projects work out to be about 3 x 40-hour weeks worth of work, so we\'re going to have to push the deadline or figure out another way to deliver this.\\"*\\n\\nInstead, you work evenings and weekends for free for a company you don\'t own or have shares in.\\n\\n\u201cIt\'s not that easy, Ron. We have families to feed and bills to pay.\u201d\\n\\nSure, but do you think the way you see yourself and the world and how you carry yourself, given those perspectives, are compartmentalised at work and don\'t perpetuate themselves in other aspects of your life?\\n\\nWhat about with your family? Your relationships? Pretty much every area of your life?\\n\\nHow you provide for your family and how you pay your bills have a lot to do with how you see yourself and your level of confidence in who you are and what you can do.\\n\\nI\'ve talked to a talented software engineer who is missing out on at least 20k (minimum) in salary because he lacks the confidence to back himself in a pay negotiation and leverage the cost-benefit factor at his company should he search for other roles.\\n\\nI\'ve helped a loved one \u201cpull the trigger\u201d and hand in their resignation after an absolutely terrible pay review process. They didn\'t feel they deserved what they were asking for, only to be given everything they requested and more the minute the resignation email was received.\\n\\nI\'ve seen talented engineers strain their own and their families\' mental health because they can\'t say no to work or to a manager and set healthy boundaries (FYI resigning is setting a boundary) to keep their lives manageable.\\n\\nI didn\'t just wake up to this realisation overnight.\\n\\nI spent years as a systems engineer, working until midnight multiple times in the office, juggling a portfolio of stressful projects that all seemed to be \\"high priority.\\" I felt stretched thin and trapped with few options because I didn\'t believe in myself enough to know that I could leave and find a better situation.\\n\\nAs my confidence in my abilities changed - through experience and with the help and support of people I respected personally and professionally - so did my behaviour.\\n\\nI moved to contracting and started backing myself on job applications, pay negotiations, my expert opinion on technical matters in projects and I would regularly practice setting boundaries around hours of work and contact.\\n\\nI was still just an engineer, building things in the cloud, advising on things like CICD, Container security and Kubernetes - I was just going about it differently and not accepting anything less than what I knew I was worth in terms of money and respect.\\n\\nEverything springs forth from you\u2014the person, you.\\n\\nIf you\'re not in a good space, what springs forth from that?\\n\\nNothing good.\\n\\nWho\'s looking after you?\\n\\nWell, it better damn well be*you*if nobody else, because it\'s nobody else\'s responsibility.\\n\\nI know it sounds obvious when you say it, but if your vessel, the one physical vehicle you have to drive in this world (i.e., your body; sure, the mind is included in this concept), is running like shit, how on earth are you going to execute anything you want to get done in this world?\\n\\nIf your mind is so sleep-deprived, stressed, and mentally ill that you can\'t focus on good communication or take in and process information, seriously, what are we even talking about at that point?\\n\\nI watched a short clip about professional athletes where a coach was saying, \\"they don\'t do anything extraordinary\u2014they just do ordinary things, but they do it extra, i.e., daily.\\"\\n\\nSure, it\'s a little bit of playing with semantics, but I think the point remains.\\n\\nDo the things that look after*you*, and do them consistently.\\n\\nKeep the vessel in check, make sure it gets sleep, hydration, some exercise.\\n\\nDon\'t eat too much junk.\\n\\nTalk to your friends and family regularly.\\n\\nGet off the devices.\\n\\nJournal some stuff every day; it doesn\'t have to be War & Peace, just offload some of that stuff in your head onto paper and move on, at least a little bit, with your life.\\n\\nAs long as you check this stuff off first, as a priority[1](#footnote-1)the rest of whatever you want for your life can sit on top of that foundation with a half-decent chance of actually making it.\\n\\nI\u2019m not sure I meant for this weeks newsletter to be a ranty one, but I think when the work busy season is starting to ramp into full swing, this message of \u201clook after yourself\u201d becomes even more important for everyone, including myself, to hear.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading - see you in the next one.*\\n\\nShare*If you genuinely found this post interesting, please give it a \u2764\ufe0f to let me know \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd*\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m actively studying or learning this week\u2026*\\n\\n- \u2018AWS Certified Security - Speciality\u2019- Practice Exams\\n\\n- Studying for the\u2018AWS Certified Security - Speciality\u2019certificate:100% Completed.\\n\\n### Building\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m building or working on this week\u2026*\\n\\n- PTO and overseas this week for work - minimal building time this week.\\n\\n### Interesting Reads\\n\\n*Articles or other writing that stood out to me this week\u2026*\\n\\n- I need to get back to my readwise reading list.\\n\\n### Community\\n\\n*Other projects in community I\u2019m working on\u2026*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Education Charity-*Providing Tech Learning Opportunities for the Pasifika Community.*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Network-*A Network for Pasifika Tech Professionals & Learners.*"},{"id":"your-language-connects-you-to-your-identity-super","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/your-language-connects-you-to-your-identity-super","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-05-31 - Your-Language-Connects-You-to-Your-Identity-and-Super-Samoan-Power.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-31 - Your-Language-Connects-You-to-Your-Identity-and-Super-Samoan-Power.md","title":"Your Language Connects You to Your Identity and Super (Samoan) Power.","description":"Connects language fluency to cultural identity as foundation preventing disenfranchisement and providing confidence in navigating life.

I didn\'t grow up working the plantation, riding the bus to the market with produce to sell, or cutting the grass with a machete (they have weed whackers now) and I don\'t remember the struggle of learning English because I was immersed in it at the age of 5 in a Dunedin primary school.\\n\\nThis is the kind of experience that starts to separate you from who you are: you speak your language less because you feel ashamed it\'s not up to a certain standard, and before you know it, you\'ve all but repressed it down to only be used in short bursts and only around family who won\'t make fun of you.\\n\\nThe danger of repressing your language and not using it here in New Zealand is that there\'s already not a lot of opportunities to use it, and the less you use it, the less connected you are.\\n\\nThe less you\'re connected, the less you identify.\\n\\nThe less you identify, the less grounded and more lost you become.\\n\\nThere\'s a reason the disenfranchised get radicalised and picked up by extremist groups and gangs. They don\'t know who they are; they\'re looking for somewhere to belong and something they can identify with.\\n\\nIf the language they learn there is violence and hate, then they\'ve learned the language of that identity.\\n\\nThat\'s not really a \\"culture\\" I want to see growing out of the space left behind by people not having a healthy sense of identity, whatever that may be.\\n\\nI\'m not saying that being Samoan is my whole identity. I\'m a lot of things, but I\'m also very much Samoan.\\n\\nTo separate myself from that, to not feel like I can identify with what I see in the mirror, the stories, values, and principles of my parents, my grandparents, and my ancestors back on the Islands - that\'s a lot to take away from a person and think they can just carry on like there\'s not this massive void in their person they can\'t seem to fill with anything else.\\n\\nI\'ve been there; I\'ve wandered those streets trying to figure out who I was, where I belonged and why there was always something missing from the different answers I found.\\n\\nI had to take it \\"back to first principles\\": I\u2019m Samoan.\\n\\nI grew up around Irish and Scottish friends, most of them born here, who celebrated their language, saints\' holidays, foods, dances, and sports. They were proud of their heritage, and to see them with their kilts, playing bagpipes, sword dancing, and eating haggis, just doing their thing, gave me a sense of pride for them.\\n\\nEven though when we were in the same uniform at school, they were just another group of white guys - when they were standing, grounded in their cultural identity, it just hit different; they just seemed (for lack of a better word) -*deeper*.\\n\\nAnd it\'s the same when I attended an Indian friend\'s wedding or my wife\'s Niuean friend\'s wedding. During Diwali, the whole of Aotea Square is packed with the Indian community, throwing a badass party where everyone is dancing and having a great time. The same with the Chinese Lantern Festival, we all marvel at the amazingly and skilfully crafted lanterns while smashing all the delicious foods.\\n\\nAn identity doesn\'t make you better or worse than anyone (no supremacies here, thank you); it\'s something that gives you a base, a foundation of strengths to work from that supports you as you navigate your life.\\n\\nIt\'s like having your own superpower.\\n\\nYou\'re going to have enough doubts and shit-talkers in your life; at least have your identity be one of the things that gives you something solid to stand on and not a void in your soul that has you always asking a question with no answers.\\n\\nIf you can speak a language, it gives you insights into that culture; it connects you to and unlocks for you the ideas, perspectives, and values found within.\\n\\nTo make a geeky analogy for just a second, understanding a programming language\u2014knowing how it\'s written, how it functions within an operating system, its syntax and style, strengths and weaknesses\u2014equips you with a deep cultural connection with that code and program (right PHP and Perl programmers!?! haha kidding).\\n\\nThe same concept applies to most things: business, hospitality, economics - if you speak any of those fluently, there aren\'t too many places within those topics you wouldn\'t stand with a lot of confidence and authority.\\n\\nYou\'re not the \\"boss,\\" but you definitely know who you are when it comes to those topics.\\n\\nLearn your language, speak and be proud of your language, and stand grounded in your identity it brings.\\n\\nI\'ll leave you with this, from the Ministry of Pacific Peopleswebsite:\\n\\n*Thanks for reading - see you in the next one.*\\n\\nShare*If you genuinely found this post interesting, please give it a \u2764\ufe0f to let me know \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd*\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m actively studying or learning this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Studying for the\u2018AWS Certified Security - Speciality\u2019certificate - 91% through the course: ELB Architecture.\\n\\n### Building\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m building or working on this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Samoan Language Bot powered by GPT\u2014 done.\\n\\n### Interesting Reads\\n\\n*Articles or other writing that stood out to me this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Another slow week on the reading\u2026 need to do less stuff.\\n\\n### Community\\n\\n*Other projects in community I\u2019m working on\u2026*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Education Charity-*Providing Tech Learning Opportunities for the Pasifika Community.*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Network-*A Network for Pasifika Tech Professionals & Learners.*"},{"id":"changing-how-you-see-work-changes-how-you-play-game","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/changing-how-you-see-work-changes-how-you-play-game","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-05-24 - Changing-How-You-See-Work-Changes-How-You-Play-the-Game.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-24 - Changing-How-You-See-Work-Changes-How-You-Play-the-Game.md","title":"Changing How You See \\"Work\\" Changes How You Play the Game.","description":"Explains how understanding corporate game mechanics transforms career outcomes from reactive victim to strategic player with agency.

If you see the workplace in any way paternalistic, like it\'s going to look after you, that if you do the right things and perform well, that it buys you job security, you may be in for an unpleasant surprise.\\n\\nI\'m not saying this to be cynical. Doing a good job and the right things is great! Your workplace and company will be well pleased with you, for sure. I\'m saying you\'re misunderstanding what incentives are keeping you employed.\\n\\nThinking like this leads people waiting for training budgets before they up-skill themselves. They could be waiting a while before seeing any budget, and even then, they may be limited in what they can spend it on. I\u2019ve also experienced situations where training budgets are allocated to a limited number of people per quarter. This is quite amusing for a few reasons.\\n\\nFirst, in the tech industry, do you think the industry is waiting on the sidelines for your training budget to turn up so you can keep up? No, it\'s full speed ahead, leaving you behind. The second is thinking you can hold the work the company wants you to do, to ransom, waiting on the training to be delivered. You are going to do the work anyway - under protest, sure - but what choice do you really have?\\n\\nWhen you find yourself here, resentful for all the extra unpaid hours you put in, evenings and weekends lost, the company loyalty you displayed so proudly, only to be disregarded as soon as you didn\'t make economic or strategic sense to the company, you\'ll ask yourself, \\"How did this happen?\\"\\n\\nYou did everything right.\\n\\nYou were just playing the wrong game.\\n\\nAnd I know because I learned these things the hard way.\\n\\nI\'ve been in these operations and engineering teams working beyond my contracted 40 hours of work time[1](#footnote-1)to deliver things outside of my job description and beyond my pay grade. Stressed, overworked, and unhappy, I still bit the bullet and delivered the work.\\n\\nI didn\u2019t have a choice.\\n\\nI know about the training budget issue because I can recall the same experience over and over again across multiple companies spanning a decade. I\'m definitely not preaching this from a high horse because I only learned about these things from making mistakes, being naive, and ignorant.\\n\\nBut once I started to understand what was happening and how things really worked, it not only changed the way I looked at things but also allowed me to change my actions and achieve the results I actually wanted in life. The results were not just about economic outcomes, landing a job, or getting a pay raise. It was also about restoring some sense of logic and reason to my life. Cause and effect became understandable and almost predictable, which brought me peace in a chaotic world.\\n\\nChanging my worldview on work, the role of the worker, the company, and the relationship between these things gave me a better understanding of the game we were all playing. This understanding helped me make the necessary moves to get what I wanted in the exchange and also to understand and manage my expectations when things fell short or didn\'t go my way.\\n\\nAdd a sprinkle of gratitude and \\"only worry about things within your control,\\" and you have a much more measured, peaceful, and clear vision of the landscape, along with a game plan with a good chance of success.\\n\\nI will leave you with a couple of major tenets that ultimately changed the course of my thinking and behavior in my dealings with work life:\\n\\n**The company is there to make a profit.**\\n\\nI can\'t stress this mental model enough. The company is an entity that exists to create a profit, utilising products, services and any and all legal, advertising, marketing and human resources available to achieve this goal.\\n\\nOnce I understood this, I stopped seeing the company and its leaders as elders in a tribe ultimately responsible for looking after me. Instead, I saw them as leaders of an entity that aims to derive as much value from my labour at the lowest possible cost to them.\\n\\nI would always assess myself in terms of where I made the most profitable sense for the company.\\n\\n**Always be ready to leave**.\\n\\nThere are two things you need to leave a company: the capacity and the will. The capacity refers to the economic aspect \u2013 do you have enough savings to sustain yourself until the next opportunity arises, or do you already have another gig lined up? The will is the actual nerve to pull the trigger, which becomes much easier when you have the capacity.\\n\\nUnderstanding the corporate game means you know you\u2019re responsible for your career, your training and skills, your work hours and health. That attitude will motivate you to save the money required to have an exit plan on standby and a healthy relationship with the corporate entity to not \u201cget in your feelings\u201d about leaving if the arrangement no longer serves you.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading - see you in the next one.*\\n\\nShare*If you genuinely found this post interesting, please give it a \u2764\ufe0f to let me know \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd*\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m actively studying or learning this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Studying for the\u2018AWS Certified Security - Speciality\u2019certificate - 74% through the course: Organisational Trail.\\n\\n### Building\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m building or working on this week\u2026*\\n\\n- I\u2019m away in PNG for work this week so no building til I\u2019m back.\\n\\n### Interesting Reads\\n\\n*Articles or other writing that stood out to me this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Slow week reading wise, nothing to report.\\n\\n### Community\\n\\n*Other projects in community I\u2019m working on\u2026*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Education Charity-*Providing Tech Learning Opportunities for the Pasifika Community.*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Network-*A Network for Pasifika Tech Professionals & Learners.*"},{"id":"advice-i-would-have-given-young-me-in-tech","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/advice-i-would-have-given-young-me-in-tech","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-05-16 - The-Advice-I-Would-Have-Given-a-Young-Me-in-Tech.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-16 - The-Advice-I-Would-Have-Given-a-Young-Me-in-Tech.md","title":"The Advice I Would Have Given a Young Me in Tech.","description":"Argues finding mentor is most impactful career advice based on personal transformation from guidance changing entire career trajectory.

It\'s not an industry familiar to our community, and we lack role models whose paths we can follow. We don\'t have the alumni network of Computer Science from the University of Auckland (at least I didn\u2019t) to provide guidance on the tech career road-map. On top of that, being young and inexperienced, without guidance from people we trusted, and now you\u2019re stacking a bunch of already \u201chard things\u201d on top of each other.\\n\\nAnd even once you\'re in, you\u2019re still the odd one out.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nYou have to read the room and make sure you don\'t unintentionally make anyone feel uncomfortable. I remember someone accusing me of being \\"intimidating\\" when they were asked why they hadn\'t followed up on an issue with me in a ticket before closing it. We had never exchanged any angry or heated words. I\'ve been mistaken for the coffee machine cleaner while waiting to make a coffee, asked for ID coming back from the bathroom by a lady I had literally just been in a meeting with, and stared at with disbelief when people I\'ve been helping on a complex technical issue over email come see me in person.\\n\\nAll of this happened in the tech industry, where I worked with \\"engineer\\" in my job title.\\n\\nI don\'t rehash these to try them in the court of public opinion, and this probably isn\'t the most enlightened or progressive view - but \u201cshit happens\u201d, and this is real life. So, I get it.\\n\\nI just wish I had a bit of a heads up on some of this at the time, y\'know?\\n\\nTo be honest, I get tired of the inequalities and disadvantages perpetuating through generation after generation, and the best we can do is conduct more research and studies to tell us what we already know. I read a story on Twitter about a Pasifika PhD candidate who overheard a mother giving advice to her daughter as she was applying for jobs after graduation. The amount of insight and knowledge the mother was able to share, based on her own experience, was awesome for her daughter. It made me realise that we often overlook the fact that inter-generational wealth isn\'t just about money and the opportunities it brings. It\u2019s also the knowledge of employment systems and navigating it all successfully. This knowledge is an enormous, unquantifiable advantage.\\n\\nThe sheer lack of guidance, knowledge, and mentorship is a significant disadvantage - for anyone sure - but I feel more so for Pasifika in the tech space.\\n\\n*How do I know?*\\n\\nLooking back over my career to write this upcoming talk, I see several periods where if I could have been there to give \\"past me\\" some advice and guidance, I would have gotten here faster and with a lot less wear and tear. I never negotiated my salary until very late in my career. I didn\'t even know that mock interviews were a thing people did to prepare for the real thing. I stayed on the same salary for years without any increase, despite taking on more responsibilities. There was no additional compensation. There were so many points early in my career where some guidance or just someone who knew the game and wanted to help would have put me years ahead of where I was.\\n\\nLuckily for me, someone eventually did.\\n\\nThe difference to my career before and after that point is literally night and day. His advice, references, and guidance set me up for my first six-figure salary in just one move. He showed me the contracting game, how to set up a company for tax and GST, negotiate contracts and rates, which technologies were in high demand in different companies, and how to navigate managers, executives, and other engineers.\\n\\nI say \\"lucky\\" because it was sheer luck he was contracting to a company I was working for, so we worked together, and he knew what I could do. But that wasn\'t enough because he didn\'t have to help me out at all. We weren\'t in the same networks, he\'s kiwi, and for anyone who knows him, he\'s a pretty grumpy bastard who doesn\'t suffer fools. He didn\'t owe me anything. But he changed my career, my financial situation, and, by extension, my life.\\n\\nMy career experience has taught me many valuable lessons, and the number one, most impactful piece of advice I can give to advance your career is to find a mentor, a guide, someone you look up to in your field. Look for someone with a resume and real-world experience that you aspire to. Get them to take you under their wing and mentor you, or at the very least, learn from them in any way you can. Of course, there is still a lot of hard work that needs to be done. I have spent countless hours learning and building tech skills across a lot of areas. However, with a mentor or guide, you can direct your focus and energy more effectively and achieve a greater return on investment for your time and effort.\\n\\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard this advice a lot - \u201cget a mentor!\u201d - so I don\u2019t know what to tell you other that I\u2019m living proof, the same me, with all my tech skills and passion, would most likely not be where I am now, without one.\\n\\nProbably more importantly - for some of the young parents in my network who are striving to succeed in the tech industry, finding more efficient ways to exchange value in their limited time will make balancing a family and a successful tech career more feasible.\\n\\nI have more tech career advice for my talk, but I\u2019ll save that for another newsletter.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading!*\\n\\nShare*If you genuinely found this post interesting, please give it a \u2764\ufe0f to let me know \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd*\\n\\n### Learning\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m actively studying or learning this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Studying for the\u2018AWS Certified Security - Speciality\u2019certificate - 64% through the course: DNSSEC using Route53.\\n\\n### Building\\n\\n*Things I\u2019m building or working on this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Hashicorp Terraform + Proxmox to deploy VMs (in my home lab) - Didn\u2019t work on this\u2026maaaaaaybe this week.\\n\\n- Hashicorp Packer + Proxmox for Cloud-init VM images for the Home lab, this week- finally got this working\u2026\\n\\n### Interesting Reads\\n\\n*Articles or other writing that stood out to me this week\u2026*\\n\\n- Another one from Abi \u2014 great article, builds on all the other things that affect developers and producing high quality code.\\n\\n### Community\\n\\n*Other projects in community I\u2019m working on\u2026*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Education Charity-*Providing Tech Learning Opportunities for the Pasifika Community \u2014 Term 2 \u201cTech Workshops\u201d kick off this week!*\\n\\n- Pasifika Tech Network-*A Network for Pasifika Tech Professionals & Learners \u2014 we\u2019ve got a Tech Meetup coming up May 18th!*"},{"id":"what-have-i-learned-writing-this-newsletter-for","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/what-have-i-learned-writing-this-newsletter-for","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-05-09 - What-Have-I-Learned-Writing-This-Newsletter-for-the-Last-Ten-Weeks.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-09 - What-Have-I-Learned-Writing-This-Newsletter-for-the-Last-Ten-Weeks.md","title":"What Have I Learned Writing This Newsletter for the Last Ten Weeks?","description":"Ten-week newsletter review identifying need for dedicated thinking time and choosing specific niche over chasing shiny topics.

I\u2019m not going to say every week it landed on time, but every week, for the last ten weeks, I sat down, wrote some things, read some things, and then edited my writing until it made some kind of sense, and then out it went. Sometimes late on a Monday night, but more often than not, at 3 am on Wednesday mornings.\\n\\nSure, ten newsletters in a row are not a lot to write home about, but I think this is a good time to step back and review what the actual hell I\u2019m doing and whether I\u2019m headed in the right direction or need to make an adjustment before carrying on.\\n\\nI started this newsletter as a mechanism for consolidating my thoughts across the many things I would think about on any given week. Anything I had learned that week, experiences I had that taught me something, I would draw on them and write it out in a weekly newsletter. I wouldn\u2019t be short of content, surely? Now, writing is a great tool for organizing your thoughts. A lot of the great thinkers of our time were writers - Plato, Marcus Aurelius (I\u2019m sure there were others), and that\u2019s something I wanted for myself too. That\u2019s the whole point of this newsletter - to write regularly, using it as a weekly opportunity to corral and organize my thoughts and develop the art of writing.\\n\\nSo, how well am I doing?\\n\\nI\u2019m a pretty harsh critic, especially of myself, but I also like to think I\u2019m fair.\\n\\n*Me to me: \u201cHey, your writing sucks. But it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re just not talented in that way.\u201d*\ud83d\ude02\\n\\nBut seriously, on reviewing these last ten weeks of writing a newsletter, I can think of two key areas where changes can be made for the better.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Time to Think\\n\\nI recently completed a short writing course for work, and in it, the writing expert showed a diagram of a timeline and positioned where and how much time the actual act of \u201cwriting\u201d would take. Believe it or not, thinking before you write took up about 60%, and the editing after you finished writing took up 30% of the timeline. And smack-bang in the middle, taking the least amount of time, was the actual writing.\\n\\nWhy is this important to my story?\\n\\nBecause in the last 3-4 newsletters, I spent increasingly less time deliberately thinking about my topic before I started writing. Instead, I spent an inordinate amount of time mashing together writing, thinking a bit, reading a bit, and editing my writing. It\'s no wonder the last few newsletters were a struggle to write, they were late, and I would end up finishing them at some ridiculous hour of the morning.\\n\\nOne thing I recognise almost immediately in hindsight is that I wasn\'t prioritising the time required to sit down, think on the topic at hand, read up, research, and intentionally process the information so that my thoughts were fully formed and ready to write.\\n\\nI have a pretty busy lifestyle of work, community work, some more community projects, some tech side projects, gym 3-4x a week, a dog, a relationship, some family, and then the \u201cbeing overwhelmed with so much on that I check out and don\'t want to do anything with my life for 4-6 hours\u201d at any given time. I say \u201cwork\u201d like my role doesn\'t mean I\'m flying internationally at least once a month, sometimes twice, and act like that has no bearing on my time and energy to then also sit, think, and write something that\'s coherent and well-thought-out. Every week.\\n\\nPossible solutions? Find a dedicated space in your life and schedule to set aside and think about the topic that\u2019s on your mind. Respect that time and space and commit to it every week. To make things easier on yourself, find a time that\u2019s not jammed in the middle of your busy schedule that will rob you of the energy you need to dedicate to this act of thinking about your topic. This isn\u2019t the writing part yet; this is just thinking about it.\\n\\nThat\u2019s the first thing, the second key area was really picking what to think about.\\n\\n## Decide on a Niche\\n\\nNow, this can be interpreted in a couple of ways.\\n\\nOne way is to choose a topic and become the one-trick pony, endlessly discussing cloud technology, which can become tedious and monotonous. It\'s possible to feel trapped once your brand is established and centred around a specific topic and you have this \u201caudience capture\u201d phenomenon happening and you just keep peddling and peddling and peddling this sh!t\u2026\\n\\nThis is clearly the \\"fever dream\\" interpretation of picking a niche.\\n\\nAnother way is to decide on a specific list of tech that you\'re interested in, and give your perspectives on the intersection with the Pasifika experience. This approach frees you from the one-trick-pony bored-out-of-my-eyeballs, content creator hell, because***you***and what you\u2019re doing with \u201ctech & the intersection with Pasifika\u201d -*are the niche.*\\n\\nI do think, focusing on a specific topic and building on it every week is really what I want from this exercise. I want to expand my knowledge, dive deeper into a particular subject, and understand it from various perspectives and use cases. By choosing topics that interest me, I can avoid getting sidetracked by all the shiny new things in the newsletters I consume, and avoid becoming shallow in my analysis, especially when I know I\u2019d probably lose interest in those shiny new things on a revisit anyway.\\n\\nOf course, this is just theory. Perhaps I can build a sophisticated understanding of a topic by chasing all the new shiny things and tying them back to my primary interest. This approach might help me consolidate my understanding of the core subject and integrate new ideas to become an extension and expression of my existing understanding. Right?\\n\\nOr maybe I do myself a favour, simplify my life by choosing a topic I\u2019m interested in and curious to learn more about, including side quests, and explore that over the next ten newsletters.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nWhy do we do this to ourselves? Well, those who know me, and my many interests and projects, know my life is self-inflicted. So I\u2019m going to keep pursuing this writing thing that needs me to think; thinking that leads me to understand; and understanding that hopefully helps me enjoy and find peace in my world.\\n\\nThat is ultimately what I want out of this life, right?\\n\\nChanges to come - firstly, make time every week to think about my topic of interest, even if it\'s just to write down the topic this week, think on it, read up on it, and only sit down next week to do the writing part. And secondly, choose a niche - like really, really pick a lane, walk around it a bit, and then stick to it for at least ten newsletters. That\u2019s the deal.

Apologies to myself, and you the reader for missing our Tuesday slot.\\n\\nThis week I think I may actually write a non essay-length edition and just speak on what was top of mind for me this last week. As you\u2019re probably aware Amazon have been going through their latest round oflayoffsthis past couple weeks, so it\u2019s been a tough space for folks at work.\\n\\nI was one of the lucky ones.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Worker and the Work\\n\\nLast week\u201cI said what I said\u201dbecause the game is still the same, and this is the nature of the beast - so I could always be next. But I read this piece recently by Baldur Bjarnason called*\u201cTheory-building and why employee churn is lethal to software companies.\u201d*He talks about how inextricably linked the worker is with the work. He describes software companies and developers and code, and how the mental models (theory) of the software - how it\'s built and how it works - come from the developers who thought about, coded, tested and watched a project grow. That if you*\\"Replace enough of the programmers, and their mental models become disconnected from the reality of the code, and the code dies.\\"*I thought this idea, and the way Baldur lays this out about the link between worker and work, was brilliant.\\n\\nBut not just for code. For all work.\\n\\n## The Only Constant Is Change\\n\\nWhen people come together, those are a lot of unique views and perspectives[1](#footnote-1)- sure some of the knowledge may be redundant, but the experience of that knowledge (which is my definition of \\"wisdom\\" i.e., knowledge from action) is unique. A piece of work comes together like only it can, with those specific elements involved. Even the way we work together depends on the people and processes involved, and anything different in those elements, changes the dynamic, the \\"vibe,\\" and ultimately the outcome of the work. Have you ever lost a teammate, or manager, or had them change a policy at work and suddenly (maybe more like \\"eventually\\") the work environment suffers? The same amount or quality of work becomes harder to deliver, eventually slipping, and before you realise (or maybe you\'re watching it the whole time with popcorn in hand cos you\'ve seen this movie before) it\'s snowballed, and work\'s no fun, people avoid the office, and it all falls apart to the point where you and a few others have started shopping your resumes around.\\n\\n## The Bad News\\n\\nThis last week, someone who was instrumental to me coming to Amazon, who convinced me the AWS role wasn\'t just another corporate gig, that it wasn\'t \u201cbrown cladding\u201d[2](#footnote-2)or, to use my good German friend\'s description, \\"getting the brown guy to sell to brown people\\" - didn\'t make it through this round of layoffs. And that sucked. He really believed in this work we\'re doing, heading into the Pacific Islands, and trying to bring the same opportunities for cloud technology, digital transformations, and tech careers to people who look like me. He\'ll be fine; he\'s a weapon and pretty highly respected and talked about by literally everyone who knows him. But we lost a piece of the team puzzle. It\'s funny because we had a catch-up when the layoffs were first announced, and nobody knew anything, and I asked him \\"what do we do?\\" and he said \\"we keep going! we\'ve got a mission and we keep going.\\"\\n\\nAnyway, that was at the top of my thoughts this past week. How the work is linked to the workers, and the impact of losing those people, not just to the work, but to the team environment they helped create and were a part of.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading. I\'ll see you in the next episode.*\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"company-not-your-family-other-professional-insights","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/company-not-your-family-other-professional-insights","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-04-26 - The-Company-Is-Not-Your-Family-Other-Professional-Insights.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-26 - The-Company-Is-Not-Your-Family-Other-Professional-Insights.md","title":"The Company Is Not Your Family & Other Professional Insights.","description":"Advises treating companies as legal entities playing economic games not families to manage expectations and navigate corporate reality.

I\'ve seen local companies decimate whole teams and watched green \\"opentowork\\" rings popping up frequently on social media. In the last week, I\'ve had friends made redundant from their remote U.S. roles, and other friends\' roles disestablished in big insurance companies in the current economic climate.\\n\\nThe theme I would thread through all these events, zoomed right out, could be described as*\\"how the world works.\\"*None of what is happening is necessarily shocking or surprising to people who see the world, and the things in it, a particular way and expect these kinds of outcomes.\\n\\nIn this weeks newsletter, I\'m not quite digging into the bigger picture of*\\"how the world works\\"*, but into the smaller*\\"how companies work\\"*and how I think about them, in this or any other economic climate, and what has served me in navigating my professional career.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## A Company Is a Company\\n\\nThis has been an important one in my experience, especially with hearing of friends being \\"loyal to the company\\" for years and then getting let go and feeling betrayed by the company. I understand the feeling; getting made redundant sucks. I\'ve been there, and it\'s not a good feeling. In my experience, my level of disappointment was directly proportional to the level of my expectations of the company.\\n\\nBut that\u2019s the problem: a company is a company, it\'s not a family. It can\'t be, and we should (especially the company) be okay with accepting those boundaries. A company is an organisation playing an economic game where it\'s building a product or service and supplying a market. It uses all the tools at its disposal, including humans, and is not in and of itself evil. It\'s just a company.\\n\\nYou can be loyal to people and your team, and go the extra mile or above and beyond to help the \\"people\\" of the company, which ultimately helps the company, but never get this twisted. A person will help you move, shout you lunch, and listen to your personal problems at work, and the company can help facilitate these things to help maintain an organisation of happy people producing goods and services for the company. A company will not give you an interest-free loan for a business idea or house you in one of its buildings because you got evicted. And you wouldn\'t expect it to, because it\'s a company, not your family. It\'s a legal entity that uses humans to conduct business.\\n\\n## Understand Organisational Structures\\n\\nThis might be getting into the weeds a bit in how to simply look at what you need to understand about \\"working in tech\\" or in organisations in general. But there\'s a lot about how the organisation is structured that helps you understand how things are going to be in that org.\\n\\nWe can take a traditional view of structures as horizontal vs vertical, where a horizontal hierarchy brings improved communications and autonomy for employees (because it\'s flatter), but because everyone\'s on the same \\"level,\\" the roles and responsibilities become unclear. On the other hand, a vertical hierarchy provides clear lines of authority up the chain, better control and oversight, but increases bureaucracy because it needs to go up the chain to get action.\\n\\nJust understanding that the structure of an organisation can immediately give you clues as to how it operates, by the very nature of the structure, to me at least, is important to understand or at least be aware of to set your expectations on how decisions get made, and where the power lies. For example, if you\'re in one of several operations teams which has a flatter hierarchy amongst them, the manager with the most influence and political savvy will be the one with the power. But if a \\"weaker\\" manager has the ear of a manager at a level up from their hierarchy (i.e. vertical), then they may be able to swing some influence that way.\\n\\nAnd this is just my observations being in the tech industry, working for many companies, big and small, and watching how these things play out for various scenarios.\\n\\nI think the \\"Executive Sponsorship\\" best practice in the AWS Well-Architected Framework\'s Operational Excellence Pillar illustrates just how important understanding the power of the organisational structure of the company is, in order to have a high level of confidence in the success of any business initiative.\\n\\nThe\\"Executive Sponsorship\\"best practice talks about the importance of getting senior leadership to \\"sponsor\\" the adoption of best practices being proposed to ensure the successful delivery of what\'s being sought. And you see this in any organization where engineering teams might want to do or build something or set a standard tech stack or infrastructure to use, but if they don\'t get that high-level \\"cover\\" or backing, i.e., \\"sponsorship\\" from an executive (or high enough) level, those ideas and initiatives don\'t have a good chance of succeeding.\\n\\nUnderstand what structure you\'re working within and know how to operate it.\\n\\n## Organisations is Politics\\n\\nEvery time I hear \\"I don\'t do office politics\\" or \\"I avoid office politics,\\" I\'m not sure the person really understands what they\'re talking about. It\'s like saying \\"When I go to the office, I avoid breathing\\" or \\"When I\'m swimming, I avoid the water.\\" If you work in an organization, public, private, not-for-profit \u2013 you will be subjected to whatever policies apply to that organization whether you like it or not.\\n\\nIf you\'re a grad, fresh out of university, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, I can expect you might think, \\"Oh no, no negativity and bad corporate vibes for me, thank you,\\" so of course, \\"I don\'t do office politics.\\" But the \\"seasoned professionals\\" I\'ve heard this from is umm\u2026 \u201cthought-provoking\u201d \ud83d\ude02 . Even if you\'re a contractor, which I have been for several years, you will still operate inside an organisation that determines what you work on and how you work on it, influenced by \u2013 office politics. I\'m guessing what seasoned pros mean by not doing office politics is maybe the company \\"rah-rah\'s\\" where they don\'t buy into the company propaganda. That I can understand. But I digress...\\n\\nPolitics is inherently a part of decision-making processes that shape the organization and is crucial in determining the policies and systems that impact daily work life.\\n\\nYou don\'t have to be Frank Underwood from House of Cards, but please keep your eyes and ears open to where the political breezes are blowing.\\n\\n## The Nature of the Beast\\n\\nI might sound like I\'m repeating myself here, where I could have said this in the \\"company is a company\\" section up top, but this point is really about the company itself. The first section was about your relationship to the company, how you see the relationship, and how it dictates your behavior and feelings towards it. When I think about wild animals and see videos of lions attacking people or elephants trampling folks or sharks eating people in the ocean, I just think to myself, \\"Yo, that\'s a wild animal. It\'s supposed to do wild animal stuff.\\"\\n\\nI think of companies the same way. It\'s a beast. It\'s going to behave according to its**environment**(country, culture, legal, political), its**inputs**(quality of executives, skill levels of workers),**incentives**(moral, economic), and**objectives**(make a lot of money, make a lot of money responsibly, make a lot of money at all cost).\\n\\nA company will make decisions that best serve the company. These include paying you as little as possible for your labor while trying to maximize the most profit from the same labor; preventing you from working for the competition when you leave their employment; layoffs for shareholder profit instead of just accepting less profit; presenting you every year with something they called a pay rise that coincidentally roughly matched whatever inflation was that year; employee of the month certificates with a gift card instead of a well-deserved pay rise.\\n\\nNow, you probably got the impression from the last paragraph that I\'m bitter and jaded about the examples I gave. But in all honesty, I\'m not. There was a time when I was jaded earlier in my career, but that was before I understood the nature of companies and what they\'re about. Big disclaimer obviously, \\"not all companies.\\" In fact, I\'m pretty happy with the company I\'m at now because I haven\'t experienced any of these. The point is, I expect companies to do everything that is in the best interest of making the company the most profit. They can choose long-term gains over short-term profits if they want. That makes good business sense (except where a business has to scrap it out in the short-term to survive and see a long-term), but again they\'re doing what\'s best for the business.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\nSo, what do we do? I like to take a big page out of the Stoic handbook of \\"Don\'t trouble yourself with things outside your control,\\" and while you should vote and provide your input and feedback at work and in your community, a lot of this stuff (above) is the status quo that you\'re currently living in, so you might as well turn your focus on things you can do to mitigate the risks associated with living and working in society as we know it today.\\n\\nFirst, as a technical person, keep your game tight. Stay on top of your discipline, stay on the tools, or near them, or at the very least understand where the tools are and where they\'re going. If you mean to move to another discipline, i.e., management, be intentional about it. Don\'t wake up one day and realize you\'re a people herder with crap people skills and rusty engineering skills. Nothing is worse than being moved around roles, skills, and responsibilities that serve the company but make you as a worker anywhere else pretty much useless because you became the IBM XML gateway expert and you can\'t find a single other company in the market that lists that as a skill they\'re after (true story).\\n\\nSecond, keep your finances in a strong position. If you work in tech, earning market rate, I really don\'t see any good reason why you shouldn\'t have the means to get yourself into a position where you have little to no debt and 3-6 months worth of expenses saved up for a rainy day, i.e., your \\"f*** you\\" money. Financial literacy and people\'s spending behavior are out of scope for today\'s newsletter. Whatever you need to tell yourself to get to a strong position, get there. It\'ll give you the mechanism to exit a toxic company, a bad manager as well as the buffer to weather a layoff or restructure. It gives you options basically.\\n\\nAnd finally, keep your network strong. The old adage \\"it\'s not what you know, it\'s who you know\\" is true. If you\'re part of a community or club, then be part of it. My mum always says*\\"don\'t ask \'what\'s in it for me?\' ask how you can be of service\\"*(pretty sure she got that from JFK \ud83d\ude02). One of my pet peeves is folks who only use their network when they want something out of it. We\'re social creatures, do you think that kind of behaviour signals someone you\u2019d want to work with? My professional network is pretty small, it\'s a handful of people whose opinions and insights in the industry I value, so I check in with a coffee or lunch - and I\'m talking a few times a year, not a weekly meeting. That\u2019s just me though.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs I was working my way through each section, thinking about the nature of companies and their behaviours, the idea that a company is not a real thing reminded me of this passage from Yuval Noah Harari\u2019s\u201cSapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\u201d\\n\\nA company is neither good nor bad; it\u2019s a \\"legal fiction.\\" It is the vehicle through which actual real-life people carry out the \\"economic game,\\" infused and imbued with all that is good and bad about people, on the company\u2019s behalf.\\n\\nSo maybe it was people all along ;)\\n\\n*Thanks for reading. I\'ll see you in the next episode.*\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"from-twitch-channels-to-pasifika-tech-networks-going","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/from-twitch-channels-to-pasifika-tech-networks-going","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-04-19 - From-Twitch-Channels-to-Pasifika-Tech-Networks-Going-Deep-to-Serve-a-Specific-Audience.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-19 - From-Twitch-Channels-to-Pasifika-Tech-Networks-Going-Deep-to-Serve-a-Specific-Audience.md","title":"From Twitch Channels to Pasifika Tech Networks: Going Deep to Serve a Specific Audience.","description":"Shares lessons building Pasifika Tech Network using minimum viable audience strategy to serve specific niche deeply versus going wide.

They used the term to describe a group of people who would engage and congregate around a product. They talked about it as a type of growth \\"hack\\" or other product-growing exercise.\\n\\nInitially, this seemed strange to me, as it made sense in terms of manipulating and using human behavior to your advantage, i.e., for profit. However, I understood what they were trying to do. I found it peculiar that it included the word \\"community\\" and treated it as something that you actively worked on (which I read as \\"manipulated,\\" because I\'m jaded, lol).\\n\\nTo me, community was always something that just \\"was.\\" They were naturally occurring things in the wild and usually formed around shared culture, a sport, or a common interest. This was obviously naive of me because \\"community\\" is something that takes deliberate work and effort to build, grow, and maintain.\\n\\nNow that I\'m building a couple of communities with my charity team and a few helping hands, I have learned a few things, about myself mostly, but also a lot about what it takes to do this work of building communities (especially online) in the community.\\n\\nThese are some of the things I have learned...\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Online is Hard\\n\\nI think building an online community is a special type of \\"hard.\\" While in-real-life communities also have their challenges, the reality of online communication being sort-of-not-really-there, but there-you-are (muted? no video?) makes it uniquely difficult.\\n\\nReflecting on my initial belief that communities just existed and worked out naturally, I should have known this would be my first lesson learned in building an online community.\\n\\nThe pandemic made us painfully aware of how difficult it is to achieve the same team cohesion and \\"bond\\" through Google Meet or Zoom meetings without in-person interactions. It is even harder for distributed teams, as your team members may live in different countries or even hemispheres when I worked at Salesforce. I\u2019m as much of an anti-social computer hermit as the next geek, and even I understand the importance of meeting people face-to-face as an essential and healthy activity for human beings.\\n\\nBecause we lack the intangible in-person energy and vibe, and all the unspoken and unconscious cues we humans signal across the office, the screen and online connection feels the way it does, lacking context and subtext. That\'s why we need to be explicit in our actions and communication online and be more forthright in order to bridge that techno-gap, that cyber limbo that exists between the person on your screen (face, username, email text) and you.\\n\\n## Engagement Is No Accident\\n\\nWhen people talk about \\"increasing engagement\\" in their communities, I often see a disconnect between that \\"want\\" and the real-world effort required to achieve that goal. Someone has to do that work.\\n\\nThe saying \\"it takes a village\u2026\\" to raise a child also applies to building a community, whether it\'s online or in real life. Because it does take a whole village to make the thing successful.\\n\\nI remember when I started a Twitch channel, I wanted to achieve affiliated status, which required having a certain number of followers and viewership. To learn from others, I subscribed to several streamers across a few genres, and I watched what they did to grow their community. What I saw was a lot of consistent, deliberate effort by streamers to engage their audiences and make their stream and platforms fun and engaging for everyone who was part of it.\\n\\nAnd they were successful.\\n\\nIt didn\'t happen overnight, but they got the community they worked for. Obviously, doing something you love, such as playing games, hacking, or watching YouTube on stream, makes the journey a little bit more bearable, but a lot of hard work and consistency balanced that out plenty, as I saw and read in articles about folks making streaming their main job.\\n\\n## Minimum Viable Audience\\n\\nThis is a term bySeth Godin, and he defines it as:\\n\\n\u201c\u2026the smallest market you can imagine. The smallest market that can sustain you, the smallest market you can adequately serve.\u201d\\n\\nWhat he\'s talking about is identifying and serving a specific audience to the best of your ability. Not going wide, but going deep.\\n\\nWhat does this have to do with what I\'m learning building a community?\\n\\nThere\'s a reason the \\"Pasifika Tech Network\\" community is for Pasifika who work in, or want to get into, the technology industry. It\'s because that\'s the smallest audience that I can serve to the best of my abilities. In the past, I tried to cover a broad range of \\"helping Pasifika\\" as my audience, building websites, online platforms, and school IT systems. There was no way I could have continued doing that long-term. But I decided to get more specific, to serve a niche (and \\"niche\\" is an understatement, lol), and I\'ve found that with my current community projects. Both projects aren\'t trying to scale to 100, they\'re not trying to mass-produce anything. They\'re both trying to provide a specific service of a specific quality to a specific audience of Pasifika who are in, or want to get into, tech.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSome last minute thoughts as I close this off at 3am on a Wednesday morning..\\n\\n1. For the record - and I say this plenty to folks I know and work alongside in the community who do actual community work as their career - I\'m not that charitable or as community-minded as my portfolio might suggest. I\'m no saint. I\'m just someone who wants to make my mum proud, and I want my people to win. If I can help make that happen, I\'m here for it.\\n\\n1. No one is entitled to a thriving community or people\'s engagement. You have to work for it, and that\'s it - no guarantees. I think if you can reconcile that, you\'ll be okay with this grind.\\n\\n1. I\'m no expert. I don\'t have a degree in sociology, and I don\'t know what the best HR practices are for producing the best communities. These are just my observations.\\n\\nI really need to sort out my schedule to post this out on time.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading.

Contrary to previous newsletters, I don\'t aim to make these reads too long. A week is not enough time to really dive deep into any one thing - I actually named this section in my template*\\"Top of Mind\\"*to be just whatever stood out to me - an idea, a quote, a thought - that I wanted to sit down and write out and think on a bit more deeply, and maybe look up a few readings. As it turns out, that\'s how these things blow out and turn into essays.\\n\\nThis week, I\'ve had one*\\"Top of Mind\\"*thought strong enough to lead me to blurt out a**blog post**to capture my thoughts on it as they came to me on the treadmill.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Setup\\n\\nLex Fridman has Sam Harris on hispodcast, and they\'re talking about a range of topics from Trump, to Elon, the pandemic, AI and everything in between. They talk about Lex having Kanye on his podcast and Sam thinks it was a mistake to do so, given it put anti-semitism on a platform and added nothing meaningful to the discourse on the subject. Because of course, Kanye no authority on the topic and he\'s been kicking off about a bunch of things and doesn\'t seem stable. So why stick a mic in his face and let him go off about the Jews? Lex believes, at the time, that organising and publishing a conversation with Kanye and letting him kick off about Jews, would***not***increase violence against Jews (Sam mentions people who play the \\"knockout\\" game where they go around punching Orthodox Jews) but instead decrease it, because of how he (Lex) conducted the interview, showing empathy towards Kanye and his ideas.\\n\\n## The Issue\\n\\nI guess looking at the setup, I could take issue with a bunch of things to talk about on all the topics discussed during the podcast i.e. the pandemic, Trump, Elon, and AI, but topics are hard, and they change, and can be subjective, so none of them really stuck out to me. But the thing that really did stand out to me was the*attitude*towards the task of, and dare I say \u201cresponsibility\u201d, of public discourse on controversial topics or any topic really. It\u2019s not about*\u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be talking about certain things\u201d*it\'s about how people arrive at \\"this is okay that I\'m going to do this, like this, in this context\\" than it is what the topic is. I think we should be able to discuss anything, but I do***not***think we\'re all qualified or capable of having any conversation we want with any audience or any scale and manage any potential fallouts.\\n\\nI thought Lex\'s reasoning that he can put that conversation with Kanye out on a massive platform because the \\"power of love\\" philosophy will win out was naive at best (I do believe Lex is a good guy and means well), problematic at worst, and overall, irresponsible.\\n\\nAgain, public discourse, talking about hard topics, all good. Who should be doing it, and why? That\'s my issue.\\n\\n## The Factor\\n\\nI think most people would understand that human behavior is different in different contexts. As the scope gets bigger, and the context changes, you have more variables to manage. People behave differently under observation than they would if they think no one is watching i.e. theobserver effect.\\n\\nWhen it comes to human-to-human communication, for example, you wouldn\'t talk the same way, even use the same terms, slang, or vocabulary in front of your family and close friends compared to your workmates, and then again to an audience of strangers (such as at a talk or conference). At least not if your goal is for everyone who hears you to understand your position. To achieve that, you would need to craft your message, its tone, language or vocabulary used, terminology and supporting explanations and examples for clarity. Even then, you\'re not going to achieve 100% of the audience of your message to fully understand what you\'re trying to say - not necessarily agree with, but at least understand.\\n\\nYes, you can\'t cater to everyone, and the ideas of \\"you can\'t please everyone\\" and acknowledging that communication is hard are important. But it\'s the hubris or recklessness of just having a swing at this, at scale, without (seemingly) enough humility to allow \\"leave it alone\\" on the table as an option for you to take. The humility to consider that you\'re not sufficiently qualified to conduct this public conversation with a reasonable level of confidence that it results in a net positive outcome for all involved.\\n\\n*Sidenote: During the episode Lex talks about how the experts during the pandemic were horrible communicators, and this is probably true, but failed to acknowledge what makes communicating at that scale, with all those variables, hard. Then doesn\u2019t seem to apply much rigour, in reflecting on Sam\u2019s criticism of his broadcasting his Kanye interview.*\\n\\n## Public Responsibility\\n\\nWhen does the size of someone\'s audience, or their reach, start determining the level of responsibility they have to take with how they conduct themselves? I had this conversation with my brother just the other night because sometimes it\'s good to have these discussions with other human beings and not just yourself at 10pm at night while writing a newsletter. He\'s a tattoo artist and business owner, so he gives me a different perspective from the tech folks I\'m usually surrounded by.\\n\\nResponsibility is a funny concept, in my experience, because it usually depends on what it costs the person who has to weigh it up. Staying with the Lex Fridman podcast, does he have a responsibility to himself to do what makes him happy? Or is it to his audience to do what keeps them entertained and engaged? Or ultimately does he have a responsibility to society at large to do what\'s, on balance, the best for everyone? I would argue that the weight of this responsibility would shift as he scales up. Does the money and notoriety mean a shift in values? A \\"reimagining\\" of what integrity means /s? Does the overall good of humanity end up weighing heaviest, and Lex stays in his Machine Learning, MIT lecturer lane? I\'m not saying he\'s any of these things, or needs to do anything I\'m saying here. The thought exercise is in how scale influences values and motivations, for anyone.\\n\\nA great philosopher once said, \\"If a person says that money doesn\'t change you, it\'s because they haven\'t made enough\\" - and 50 Cent was right. Scale matters. People will act the absolute fool with and for the right sized audience.\\n\\nMaybe we don\'t know unless we get out there and have these conversations and figure out, \\"Oh, maybe I didn\'t achieve the best outcome here, and I should leave it for someone who can.\\" Or maybe we don\'t think that\'s our responsibility, and society is going to be what it will be, and we should just live our best lives and speak our truth[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\n## The Outcome\\n\\nUltimately, I\'m not about telling people what they should or shouldn\'t do (had enough of that in my Christian upbringing). I believe in best intentions and best efforts, mantras like \\"don\'t be a dick\\", \\"be kind,\\" and \\"treat others how you want to be treated.\\" But I also believe in a bit of humility, that we\'re not always best suited to the things we want to do, that we would do them anyway not because they end up being the greater good, but because we\'re selfish people sometimes, and it\'s what we want for ourselves. We\'re not perfect; we\'re human.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading.

I also examined a specific \\"solution\\" to one of those problems, considering possible second and third-order effects that could lead to positive outcomes for my community.\\n\\nI was viewing these topics from a third-person perspective, standing outside and observing both aspects. This made me think about how these subjects come together in the present context which intersects quite conveniently with the role I currently hold in the Pacific Islands for a big tech company.\\n\\n(I thought a series of questions would organise my train of thought better, hence the following interview of myself \ud83d\ude02 \u2014 enjoy.)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What Is My Role and How Does It Look at the Pasifika and Tech Issue?\\n\\nMy role is as an AWS Partner Solution Architect for the Pacific Islands. In a nutshell, that means I meet with public and private sector organisations in the Pacific, listen to the challenges they\'re facing, and try to figure out the best solution for them using the leading cloud technology available today, Amazon Web Services (AWS) \ud83d\ude09.\\n\\nDisclaimer: all views here are my own and not of my employer.\\n\\nAt the organisational level, it\'s similar to most other corporations and government departments you might find in Australia or New Zealand. They run stuff on-premises, and they\'re trying to understand this cloud thing and leverage the technology to grow their business or serve their citizens better.\\n\\nOther than the obvious fact that the Pacific Islands are not Australia or New Zealand, the infrastructure and resources are pretty much what you would expect from a reality where the GDP of the largest Pacific Island nation is 10% of New Zealand\'s and 1.9% of Australia\'s.\\n\\nSo, we have an economic factor... and a tech solution.\\n\\nAgain - like last week, just as a tech career isn\'t suddenly going to make all Pasifika problems disappear, neither is getting everyone and their government department on the cloud going to make economic and geopolitical issues vanish for the Pacific. However, in my opinion, it\'ll definitely help.\\n\\n## What\u2019s It Like Working in the Pacific?\\n\\n*I\u2019m going to skip right over the images of holidaying in hotels, sunshine, beaches etc cos that\u2019s not really that interesting, imo.*\\n\\nOne thing that\'s struck me taking on this role and looking at the landscape in the Pacific - and I\'ve said this to a few people now - it makes me think of a large scale model of the same issues and challenges we have right here in T\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland). A few examples are:\\n\\n- In the Pacific, the internet is often unreliable, slow and data plans are expensive in fact \\"The Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and countries within Micronesia pay the highest prices globally per gigabyte of internet.\\" -\u2018Smart Islands Initiative: An affordable, accessible digital future for Pacific communities\u2019.\\n\\n- In*T\u0101maki Makaurau*the Pasifika community often can\'t afford devices and internet connections and*\\"1\xa0in\xa05 of Pacific peoples between the ages of 16 and 65 may use some technology but have no computer experience, have not passed a simple computer-use assessment, or they decline to use a computer.\\"*\\n\\nTheNZ Digital Governmentreport on digital inclusion for Pacific peoples discusses the concerns surrounding the increasing number of services moving online. This shift compounds the issue of poor access to devices and the internet, making digital banking, job applications, and class enrolment even more challenging. In PNG, I saw lines stretching around the block for people to use ATMs and see bank tellers to manage their finances. These individuals carried several forms of ID to complete their banking transactions.\\n\\n## So How Are You & Big Tech Going to Help?\\n\\nWhat\'s interesting is that another similarity between the local Pasifika community experience and that of the Pacific Island nations emerged during my visits. After leaving several very positive customer meetings in the Islands, the locals would say goodbye to me and my team as if they would never see us again, as if our visit was a one-time, Big Tech \\"tick the box\\" event, after which we\'d be gone. This reminds me of the experiences in our communities here at home, where I hear of big companies coming in, making big promises, struggling to figure things out, failing to deliver, and then never returning. I don\'t blame our communities for expecting the same from all these big companies.\\n\\nWe had to convince our customers that we would be coming back, and we did. I don\'t have another \\"patch\\" to look after; I am a Solution Architect for the Pacific Islands - not NZ and the Pacific, or ANZ - just the Pacific Islands.\\n\\nI know how some people feel about Big Tech, and everyone is welcome to navigate their life according to their values and beliefs. If you\'ve figured out how to do good in this world in your own way, more power to you. I remember as a contractor, attending the AWS Summit in Auckland in 2017, and seeing all the swanky tech crowd in their \\"smart casuals\\", lanyards swaangin\u2019, listening to speaker after speaker talking about free tiers and credits. I thought to myself, \\"Wow, all those free credits for all this cloud technology are going\u2026. to these well-paid people?!\\" Not gonna lie, it pissed me off.\\n\\nI remember thinking, \\"How do I route these free tiers, these credits, these how-tos, and this free knowledge of how to work in tech or build your own tech, to sell that tech, and get ahead to help my community?\\"\\n\\nWell, \\"Big Tech\\" hired that guy\u2014the one who got irritated by all the \\"haves\\" at the AWS Summit in Auckland and plotted how to get this tech to where it could help the most. Now he\'s part of a team dedicated to figuring out how to help folks in the Pacific Islands learn, upskill, navigate, and solve challenges with that same tech.\\n\\nIt\u2019s time for my \u201cI\u2019m not naive enough to think\u2026\u201d moment: I\u2019m not naive enough to think there\u2019s nothing in this for Big Tech and that they\u2019re saints - no, it\u2019s still a business - but as long as they\u2019re holding up their end of the bargain I\u2019m going to go ahead and help the Pacific get at all this cloud technology.\\n\\nStay tuned I guess.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading.

My newsletter and RSS feeds provided the usual tech industry topics, such as systems design, big data, and more ChatGPT. However, the most interesting topic that stood out this week for me was from the Pasifika Tech Network Discord, and it wasn\'t me asking the questions this time!\\n\\nOne of our members asked a simple question:*\\"What is your why? And what are you passionate about?\\"*\\n\\nI thought on it for a bit - I have different why\'s for different things - but the \u201cwhy\u201d I chose to respond to was \u201cwhy I use my free time to help Pasifika learn more about and see themselves in Big Tech\u201d?\\n\\nNote: this week\u2019s edition is a lot less \u201creading astutely\u201d and more shooting from the hip \ud83d\ude02.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why Help?\\n\\nThis sounds like a dumb question - and probably would be better framed \\"what are the specific reasons you have for choosing to help?\\"\\n\\nThere have been times in the past few years when I\'ve been stretched thin across a full-time career, a sporadic professional music career on the side while also trying to be nationally competitive in a sport and then trying to run a small charity teaching Pasifika kids computers & technology after school.\\n\\nSome friends would say, \u201cyou don\u2019t*have to*do it\u201d or \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to be you\u201d. And they\'re right. We all have the power to choose to do or not do something based on what we want and/or believe.\\n\\nBut that\'s not how my mum raised me. She\'d say if you see you\'re able to help someone, you should help them -*tautua*, \\"service\\" - and then she\'d say \\"Be a blessing!\\" - so there\u2019s that.\\n\\nI choose to help because I\'m a living testament to what a tech career can do for the life of a Pasifika person, and I almost feel like it wouldn\'t be right to say, \'Thanks, I\'ll be off then!\' and not do what I can to help given the state of things in the Pasifika community.\\n\\nWhat do I mean by the \u201cstate of things\u201d? Let\u2019s have a quick look at that shall we?\\n\\n## The State of Pasifika in NZ.\\n\\nThe\u201cPacific housing: People, place, and wellbeing in Aotearoa New Zealand\u201dreport was a trippy one to read.\\n\\nIt\u2019s data sources are from the 2018 Census and other surveys.\\n\\nImagine all the anecdotal data you have from friends and family\'s passing comments and conversations, and then bits and pieces of news articles alluding to the state of the Pasifika community. Now put it into a report with some official numbers, a lot of graphs, and diagrams showing the median line tracking just above the middle of the diagram, and then the Pasifika line lagging underneath it. On almost every diagram.\\n\\nThat\u2019s pretty much how this report reads - just an official publication describing, in detail, exactly how not-going-so-well your community is doing. Anyway, this isn\'t stuff we don\'t already know, or have known about for a little while now, so to call out some of the main points from the report:\\n\\nIn 1986, around half of Pasifika lived in an owner-occupied house, meaning someone in that household owned the house they were living in. By 2018, that fell to \\"just over one-third.\\" Obviously, home ownership is linked to inter-generational wealth, so that\'s on the decline.\\n\\nWhat else? Well, the report goes on to tell us that Pasifika are likely to live in large households, and those households, on average, have a lower income than the rest of the population. Great. Now it\'s important, the report says, to take into consideration that the Pacific population is a lot younger than the national median (23 years old vs. 37 years for the rest of the population), which means these youthful workers won\'t have the same earning potential as the older generation. Fair enough.\\n\\nWhat kinds of jobs do Pasifika have, though? According to the report, mostly manual labor that was hard \\"physically\\" and \\"dangerous\\" compared to the total population. Awesome.\\n\\nLuckily, figures showed that owner-occupied homes rise sharply with income, i.e., income goes up, chances of owning own home goes up! This is good news.\\n\\nSo how are Pasifika doing on incomes?\\n\\n\\"Half of Pacific peoples earn between $0 \u2013 25,000 in income. Only 5.3 per cent earn between $70,000 and $100,000 a year. Less than 5% earn more than $100,000\\".\\n\\n- and then the Pandemic hit\\n\\n- and then the housing crisis worsened\\n\\n- and then the cost of living went up\\n\\n- and then the flooding came\\n\\n- and then the cyclone landed...\\n\\nYou get the picture.\\n\\nObviously having a career in tech doesn\'t solve all of life\u2019s and society\'s problems but something pretty useful happens when the economics change for a group of people.\\n\\n## Why Tech?\\n\\nThe classic career that a Pasifika parent wants their child to pursue is usually a doctor, lawyer, or accountant. I know these careers also make a lot of economic sense. I also think the status of the profession is a draw card but I don\'t know much about those other careers to comment; I just know it\'s a lot of hard work and studying, and then the work-life is pretty hectic if any of the medical TV shows are anything to go by.\\n\\nBut everything in life worth having is \u201chard work and studying\u201d anyway\u2026 so why tech?\\n\\n### Economics & Accessibility\\n\\nNothing radical or out of the box here - techjobs payrelatively well.\\n\\nIf I\'m Pasifika, statistically earning something between $0 and $25,000 NZD a year, working a physically taxing and probably dangerous job, then a Level 1 Service Desk tech job in Auckland - according to*Hays Salary Guide 2023*- is paying an average of $55,000 NZD p/a. Then sitting on my ass, answering phones, and troubleshooting technical problems (\\"have you tried turning it off and on again?\\") is going to be a step up both in pay and physical well-being (if it doesn\'t go too far the other way, and now we\'re doing the statistically diabetic Pacific Islander thing).\\n\\nOne thing I loved about the tech industry was the fact I was able to go online and download the software that companies were running, such as Apache web servers, LAMP stacks, WordPress, etc., and run it at home. I taught myself how to use it from people online, and then I went and got a job with that skill. Sure, I\'m oversimplifying it, and people\'s mileage may vary, but if I wanted to be a web developer, I would teach myself a tech stack, build some things on GitHub, get familiar with some software architecture and systems designs online, and then go convince a hiring manager that the thing they do on the inside of the company is what I\'m also doing at home in my spare time, which is practically the same thing - and that they should give me the role.\\n\\nAll that to say, tech building, doing, learning, and help were readily available online.\\n\\nSo you can make decent money with skills you can obtain online, and yes, a big call-out here is this glaring fact: Pasifika communities are in need of devices and internet connections. All the great online content means nothing if you can\u2019t get to it in the first place.\\n\\nJust remember, this is just me laying out my reasoning for my \\"why\\" in tech. All related problems will be dealt with in due course.\\n\\nWhat else stood out for me when looking at the tech opportunity?\\n\\n### No Gatekeepers\\n\\nI remember \\"back in the day\\" one of my brothers, who is an actor, wasn\'t getting many parts (there weren\'t many parts for Pasifika back then either, but that\'s a story for another time), and I saw YouTube as a way to basically have your own TV station and write, shoot, and produce your own shows. He ended up shooting a successful web series with his actor buddies, and producing other content for other YouTube channels.\\n\\nMy other brother and his friends would make music with software they had \\"obtained online\\" and produced tracks that would go on to land them record deals as producers and working in the NZ music industry. ThenSoundCloudbecame a thing, and anyone and everyone was able to just put their stuff out there in \\"the market\\" and not go the record deal and debt way.\\n\\nAnd then there\u2019s me in geek world - when I wanted to learn an operating system that runs web servers and hosts files for companies, I would download that, install it, learn how to configure it, and build things on top of it. Something something something... I\'m working at Amazon Web Services today.\\n\\nLook, I know I say this bit a lot, i.e., the \\"I\'m not naive enough to think,\\" but I\'m not naive enough to think gatekeepers don\'t exist anymore, and I\'m definitely not saying a couple of JavaScript tutorials will have you working for Google. I\'m just saying tech has these angles that you can work to still get in the game and thrive, even if you don\'t go via the \\"traditional\\" route.\\n\\n## Why a Gambit?\\n\\nI\u2019ll be honest, I just wanted to use the wordGambitbecause he\u2019s my favourite character from X-Men.\\n\\nBut let\u2019s make it work: if agambitis a move where a player risks something in order to gain an advantage, then Pasifika making the move into tech is the gambit. It\'s a sacrifice of being the minority in unfamiliar, possibly hostile territory to gain that economic advantage that could change your, your family\'s, and your community\'s lives.\\n\\nWorks.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nMy Pasifika community, first of all, is awesome and not defined by the statistics in some report.\\n\\nNo, the data is not great, and I\'m not the one to ask what the answer is.\\n\\nI can\'t help anyone with the systemic racism and unconscious bias that affects us at school, work, or in the judicial system. But if a higher income leads to home ownership and inter-generational wealth, higher quality of health and living, because the house isn\'t damp and the workers in the house are straining their brains and not their muscles in a dangerous work environment, working fewer hours, possibly with little to no commute, so they can spend more time with their families raising them in a home that\'s not poverty-stressed...\\n\\nthen I may have some answers for that.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading.

There\'s been a lot of discussion and activity in my Pasifika Tech Network discord as well as the developers have been playing with creating slack and discord bots that use the OpenAI API.\\n\\nBut there\'s one topic that I can\'t recall how it came to my attention this week; it crossed my mind early one morning after studying for my AWS certification - Data Sovereignty. It\'s a topic I frequently deal with, given that I work at AWS and my job involves discussing cloud technology with all sovereign nations in the Pacific. Since it\'s a pretty important topic in the Pacific, I wondered what my network\'s understanding of it was, so I asked in the channel.\\n\\n\\"Morning team- this is always an interesting question when I come across it at work (in NZ and in the Islands) so keen to hear everyone\'s thoughts - What do you know/understand about Data Sovereignty? And what do you think about the issue of where our (Pasifika/Indigenous) data is stored?\\"\\n\\nI got back some really thoughtful answers, and interesting to note was that the people that responded were all senior level technical folks. They mentioned things like physical location of the data and the governance and applicable laws of that location i.e. country. It was interesting to also see talk about trust between allied countries and data residency agreements and what they mean for NZ for people working specifically with NZ data.\\n\\nNow, no surprises here - I\u2019m not an expert on this topic by any stretch of the imagination. I\u2019ve just done some reading, and combined that knowledge with my experience and understanding of the topic gained over the last 8 months of working in the field.\\n\\nI will leave links to all readings and resources I read to understand any of this, below.\\n\\n### Disclaimer\\n\\nObviously, I\'m going to have some bias on this subject. I work at Amazon Web Services as a Solution Architect, and most of the data relevant to the work I do resides on AWS infrastructure. However, I believe the crux of this entire topic is that the geographical location of the data and the ownership of the infrastructure are only the beginning of what this subject is effectively about. For the record, I do not speak for or on behalf of my employer. All opinions expressed here are my own.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Storing vs Collecting\\n\\nBefore really looking into the different issues regarding data sovereignty, I was pretty focused on just the area of this topic that was \u201cwhere is my data stored?\u201d and \u201cwho can access it?\u201d. However sections like*\\"Data rights and interests\\"*outlined in The*Te Mana Raraunga Charter**,*and*\'Indigenous data sovereignty : toward an agenda / editors: Tahu Kukutai, John Taylor.\'*talk about the collection and disaggregation of indigenous data, which speaks to how indigenous peoples\' data is being harvested and utilised without their consent, control, or benefit. This is not just about where it\'s stored, although that\'s one element in the arguments around this topic.\\n\\nI\u2019m not going to be looking at that aspect of Data Sovereignty here because it\u2019s way outside my pay grade and warrants a lot more than some preliminary readings and understanding of technology.\\n\\n## Rights vs Access\\n\\nIn my experience working with and talking to people across the Pacific (and this is anecdotal, obviously), but a lot of the time, the issue of \\"sovereignty\\" has boiled down to \\"who can access our data?\\" and \\"is it secure?\\". The cloud is new for a lot of folks in the region, so it\'s understandable to have some fear of the unknown. Just knowing that you are the only ones who have access to your data and that encryption of your data with keys you control is the recommended best practice anywhere usually allays the initial fears of*\\"unauthorised access\\"*. We could get into theories of backdoors and corporate employees cruising through customer data at will, but I think I\'ll choose to spend my energy on things I\'ve actually come across.\\n\\nI\'m not saying governments haven\'t debated installing backdoors into software and encryption methods to \\"save us from the terrorists\\" in the past. Or that companies haven\u2019t been crap at keeping data secure. I\'m saying let\'s apply a little critical thinking (yes, we keep an open mind, but let\'s make sure that opening\'s not big enough for our brain fall out of) and think what can reasonably be expected, so we can spend the appropriate amount ofexistential dreadanxietyconcern on these things.\\n\\n*\\"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\\" -- Hanlons Razor*\\n\\n### Local is not Sovereign\\n\\nThis argument has been an interesting one to follow through the various pieces written online by people with vested commercial interests in the outcome as well as folks with ideological interests in not having local data reside on foreign owned company infrastructure, even if that infrastructure is in New Zealand.\\n\\n\\"Even though your data may be held locally (in your own country) if it is hosted by a global cloud services provider this means employees of that provider, who reside in different jurisdictions, can access your data and configuration details from overseas \u2013 unless you have data sovereignty.\\"\\n\\nIt\u2019s statements like these that make me question whether the person saying this is being deliberately disingenuous. Or if they*really*believe that random employees of these overseas companies are accessing customer databases, and storage systems for customer \u201cdata and configuration details\u201d with no authorisation?\\n\\nThe \u201cfrom overseas\u201d bit paints an interesting picture as well, like it\u2019s a thief coming in through your window to steal your data and configuration?\\n\\nAnd \u201cunless you have data sovereignty\u201d - is this a new sovereign nation with its own laws and agreements outside of international laws and agreements, that magically stops these random overseas employees accessing customer data cos your account has a \u201cdata sovereignty\u201d stamp on it?\\n\\nYes I\u2019m belabouring my point that this statement is, in my opinion, insane.\\n\\nFrom my discussions about this issue with policy experts at work, I understand that the concept of international cooperation and exchange of information and intelligence between countries is nothing new. There is a process and a mechanism for making, reviewing, and challenging requests. The CLOUD Act (below) made some updates, but otherwise, the process remains the same \u2014 you obtain a warrant, request the data, and the provider goes ahead and challenges it anyway because - \\"business\\".\\n\\nYou\u2019ll see what I mean by \u201cbusiness\u201d later on.\\n\\nBut now that I\u2019ve called it out, let\u2019s have a quick look at this CLOUD Act.\\n\\n## The Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act\\n\\nThe CLOUD Act was passed on March 23, 2018, by the United States Congress, updating the legal framework to provide U.S. law enforcement with a mechanism to request data from foreign countries using a warrant. The act also includes provisions about bilateral data-sharing agreements. In a nutshell, the previous methods, such as mutual legal assistance treaties and warrants under the Stored Communications Act (SCA) for U.S.-based requests, were slow and cumbersome. The CLOUD Act was designed to create a more efficient mechanism for these processes.\\n\\nThe CLOUD Act is the big one that gets specifically called out in the articles I\'ve read. To be honest, it reeks of scare mongering from people with commercial and ideological interests. While I\'m all for protecting people from oppressive authority and abuse, we have to be cautious of chasing every \u201cwolf story\u201d out there or we\u2019re going to get fatigued quick.\\n\\nAs you can expect, all major cloud providers have had their say about the CLOUD Act and what it means for their customers such asMicrosoft and the CLOUD Act, andOracle and the CLOUD Act.\\n\\nThe responses largely indicate that the Act is frequently misunderstood, for example:\\n\\n***Does the CLOUD Act take precedence over another country\'s local law?***\\n\\nNo. The CLOUD Act does not change another country\'s local laws. In fact, the CLOUD Act recognizes the right for service providers to challenge requests that conflict with another country\'s laws or national interests.\\n\\n\u2014*AWS and the CLOUD Act*\\n\\nand that the providers will challenge these request from everyone to protect customers data, e.g.\\n\\n\\"When AWS receives a request for data located outside the United States, we have tools to challenge it and a long track record of doing so. In fact, our challenges typically begin well before we go to a court. Each request from law enforcement agencies is reviewed by a team of legal professionals. As part of that review, we assess whether the request would violate the laws of the United States or of the foreign country in which the data is located, or would violate the customer\u2019s rights under the relevant laws. We rigorously enforce applicable legal standards to limit \u2013 or reject outright \u2013 any law enforcement request for data coming from any country, including the United States. We actively push back on law enforcement agencies to address concerns, which frequently results in them withdrawing their request.\\" \u2014*AWS and the CLOUD Act*\\n\\nI understand the argument, \'they\'re just a big corporation; they\'ll say anything, even if it\'s not true.\' I get that. However, I also believe that being a corporation is precisely what ensures the protection of customer data from \'unfettered access.\' They are a business, and they won\u2019t stay in business for long if they can\u2019t be trusted.\\n\\n## Trust is Business\\n\\nI may be naive in my thinking, but if we\'re saying the almighty dollar is king to corporations - and we see examples of this in both support and disapproval of problematic public figures by advertisers, depending on which way public opinion (i.e., customers) goes - then maintaining a \\"tight\\" relationship between customer and provider would be a relationship that\'s protected at all costs. Not because companies inherently love and cherish people, but because they are a business. It\'s just good business to maintain trust.\\n\\nI know we can find plenty of examples of businesses being pretty shitty to people in the name of shareholder profits, etc., after all, capitalism is the system we\'re all operating under. That\'s why I think it doesn\'t make good business sense to violate this trust by not protecting customer data through all legal means available.\\n\\n## Indigenous & M\u0101ori Data Sovereignty\\n\\nAgain, when diving into the topic of data sovereignty in terms of indigenous people, it\'s a massive topic, and one I\'m not qualified or knowledgeable enough to discuss.\\n\\nI\'ve read through*\'\u201cHe Matapihi Ki Te Mana Raraunga\u201d - Conceptualising Big Data Through a M\u0101ori Lens\'*where it outlines what I understand as data classification and policies with which I\'m familiar in terms of standard data security frameworks - but using M\u0101ori terms. I then looked at\'Indigenous Versus M\u0101ori Data Sovereignty\'which acknowledges the differences between Pacific nations and M\u0101ori data sovereignty but states, \\"there are elements and ties that unify us as the People of the Moana.\\"\\n\\nMy big takeaway from these few texts is that I need to read and understand a lot more about the subject, and probably learn from more knowledgeable people in the field to really grasp what it\'s all about.\\n\\nI understand that colonisation plays a significant role in the concerns surrounding how this topic is handled and implemented, and I think it\'s crucial that it\'s done correctly moving forward. However, this is way outside my area of expertise - I\'m the cloud guy. I just want to make sure you encrypt, control, and can access your own data and that you have the correct information to make the best decisions for yourself.\\n\\nLastly, on the topic of making technical decisions for yourself...\\n\\n## Random Private Clouds: Run at your own Risk.\\n\\nIn an effort to protect themselves from big tech and keep their data safe and secure, I\'ve seen people recommending running one\'s own server or private cloud. This is great for geeks (like myself) and other technical people who do this for a living. However, in my opinion, it\'s really irresponsible to mislead people into thinking that it\'s easy to do and to leave out the maintenance aspect of running infrastructure! That\'s a huge risk. As we constantly say in the industry when it comes to running any kind of infrastructure or software - \\"patch your shit\\" - because there\'s a bug or vulnerability that comes out so regularly that you have to be vigilant if you don\'t want your systems\u201cgetting popped\u201d.\\n\\nI\'m not saying don\'t run your own server; I\'m saying please understand what it means to run and maintain a server if you want your data to remain secure.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAnother long one - I honestly do no set out to write these long ass pieces, these last two have just turned out that way. Anyway\u2026\\n\\nI\'ve talked mainly about cloud providers\' storage, access, and disclosure of people\'s data, specifically indigenous people, and what \\"sovereignty\\" of that data effectively means - in a nutshell, it\'s about protection from unauthorised and unlawful access. The CLOUD Act fear may be overstated, at least considering the fact that there have beenzero disclosuresas a result of any requests by the U.S. government for data located outside the U.S. (by AWS). I probably didn\'t emphasise it enough, but encryption is real - and is recommended for all your data, which most providers make available to secure all your information. Please do this by default.\\n\\nHowever, I think ultimately the real data sovereignty issue is the collection and use of indigenous data by governments and other entities without the express rights and permissions of indigenous people over their data. That\'s the real fight, in my opinion, and one that makes much more sense than the other issue, which can be nullified with a strong encryption key.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading.

It\u2019s been a hot topic for a short while now since ChatGPT\u2019s release in November, 2022 and there\u2019s no shortage of articles about it in myReadwisefeed.\\n\\nThere\u2019s been a lot of takes, some pro, some con. My friend DZ\u2019snewslettergot me thinking about the darker side of AI and so I thought I\u2019d read up on it this past week and write some stuff down.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a bit of a read so if you don\u2019t mind a bit of profanity and bad punctuation, enjoy.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## What is ChatGPT & AI Reaaaally?\\n\\nLet\u2019s start with what we know about ChatGPT.\\n\\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI and built on top of OpenAI\u2019s GPT3 family of \u201cLarge Language Models\u201d (**LLM**) and fine tuned using supervised and reinforcement learning techniques[1](#footnote-1).\\n\\nThe**GPT**stands for*\u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer\u201d*. The**Generative**part means it generates human-like text. It\u2019s**Pre-trained**on a massive amount of text data (publicly available data from the internet for example) and uses the \u201c**Transformer**\u201d deep learning model that uses mechanisms to pay attention to and weigh the significance of the words in the data it\u2019s processing.\\n\\n### AI: But How Intelligent?\\n\\nMaybe it\u2019s just me but it took looking further into what \u201cintelligence\u201d actually means here in the context of AI to understand that\u2019s it\u2019s notT1000about to suddenly figure out how to chase us down and kill us all with multiple martial arts techniques it has just watched on TV.\\n\\nAI is trained on a very specific thing, so its deep on that one thing, and pretty useless at anything outside of it e.g. an AI beat a chess grand master but would fail a basic maths test because it has no idea what you\u2019re talking about i.e. it hasn\u2019t been trained on maths.\\n\\n### So What\u2019s AGI?\\n\\nThis is a super oversimplified take on the difference, but I think it\u2019s important to know that there are two different \u201cAI\u201d that people talk about, and will sometimes confuse and conflate when talking about the thing that\u2019s going to take over the world and kill us vs. the one that\u2019ll beat us at chess.\\n\\nAGI, thanks to Wikipedia, is:\\n\\n**Artificial general intelligence** (**AGI**) is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that human beings or other animals can.\\n\\nSo, AI will only know how to kill us if we train it accordingly. But AGI will figure out how to kill us all on its own.\\n\\nAGI aside, how are we training these AI models?\\n\\n## How Are These AI Being Trained?\\n\\nYou could be forgiven for thinking the AI world is a super slick computer enhanced synthesis of automation and maths wizardry efficiency.\\n\\nIt\u2019s not.\\n\\nOpenAI\u2019sblogtell us:\\n\\nWe trained an initial model using supervised fine-tuning:**human AI trainers**provided conversations in which they played both sides\u2014the user and an AI assistant. We gave the trainers access to model-written suggestions to help them compose their responses.\\n\\nOk, so humans help train these models.. tell me more\\n\\nTo create a reward model for reinforcement learning, we needed to collect comparison data, which consisted of two or more model responses ranked by quality. To collect this data, we took conversations that AI trainers had with the chatbot.\\n\\nCool. More humans, doing the fine-tuning.\\n\\nYou can see humans in Steps 1 & 2 of the OpenAI diagram (Step 3 is what the marketing hype sounds like.. \u201cwhat humans?!\u201d)\\n\\nSo what? People are being employed to provide training to AI models.\\n\\nSure, let\u2019s have a look at these workers\u2026\\n\\n## Humans of AI Development\\n\\nFollowing my nose and reading through the lesser known and talked about (at least on my mainstream social media) articles on the negative aspects involving AI has been educational and unsurprising.\\n\\nNone of this negative shit is new. The powerful exploit the less powerful. It\u2019s like a law of nature at this point.\\n\\nIn 2017, Mary L. Gray and Siddharth Suri wrote\u2018The Humans Working Behind the AI Curtain\u2019citing Facebook\u2019s supposedly \\"unbiased algorithm\\" that turned out to be powered by regular humans (you know, the kind susceptible to \\"bias\\"). Imagine my surprise to find that, in 2022, Chloe Xiang\'s piece\u2018AI Isn\u2019t Artificial or Intelligent\u2019suggests we\'re pretty much in the same position, powering our AI innovation with underpaid workers in foreign countries, or by the better-known term, the \\"Global South\\".\\n\\nIn 2016, it was people like middle-aged mother of two Kala, sitting on a computer in Bangalore, India, looking through NSFW content for the likes of Google, Facebook, and Twitter. In 2022, we\'ve either expanded or just relocated the \\"crucial contributions\\" work to Kenya, where we read about it in Time\'s\'Inside Facebook\'s African Sweatshop\'in February, with Vice bringing it home in Jan 2023 with an article detailing how \u2018OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers Making $2 an Hour to Filter Traumatic Content From ChatGPT\u2019.\\n\\nBut this is all OK. You know why? Cos \u201cimpact sourcing\u201d /s\\n\\n### \u201cImpact Sourcing\u201d\\n\\nNow I\u2019ve heard some bullshit in my time when it comes to tech marketing, or corporate social responsibility marketing and branding but learning this term \u201cimpact sourcing\u201d in the context of this AI training work has been an absolute stunner.\\n\\nWhat is \u201cimpact sourcing\u201d?\\n\\n**Impact sourcing**, also known as**socially responsible outsourcing**, refers to an arm of thebusiness process outsourcing(BPO) industry. It employs people at thebase of the pyramidor socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals as principal workers in BPO centers to provide**high-quality**, information-based services to domestic and international clients.\\n\\nYou could only seriously believe you are bettering the lives of these workers if you believe the PTSD from sorting through NSFW text and images every day, for $2 an hour, is an improvement on their lives.\\n\\nAnd I guess that\u2019s the point, we believe these people are beneath us and our AI goals.\\n\\nNot necessarily that we literally think the thought \u201cwe are better than them\u201d, but that our actions will amount to \u201cthey are not important enough for us to change our behaviour that\u2019s complicit in this outcome\u201d.\\n\\nWhich brings us to\u2026\\n\\n## The Classic \u201cUs\u201d vs \u201cThem\u201d\\n\\nIt\u2019s just a matter of distinguishing which \u201cus\u201d is \u201cus\u201d this time. Poor? Non-white? A little from column A, a little from column B? A Union B?\\n\\n### The Class War.\\n\\nWe all know about the inherent biases in our technology. We\u2019ve known about it for a while now.\\n\\nWe\'ve long talked about and identified how the lack of representation and input at the \\"tables\\" of those who develop and build our tech result in things like cameras that can\'t pick up black skin, ormedical schoolcomputer program inviting applicants for interviews based on gender and non-European names.\\n\\nAI brings a whole other dimension to that. Dan McQuillan in his piece\'We Come to Bury ChatGPT, Not to Praise It.\'[2](#footnote-2)talks about how OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks of people as \'stochastic parrots\' - meaning people are just large language models with learned patterns of behaviour and nothing more (yes, paraphrasing and simplifying). It\'s an idea seemingly only applied to us ordinary folk, and the \\"elites\\" of our society are apparently something better. So of course, us \\"ordinary folk\\" are perfect fodder to feed the AI machine meant to serve the upper class withfree training labourfor Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA to train their models.\\n\\n### Digital Colonialism.\\n\\nI\'m introduced to the idea of \\"Digital Colonialism\\" in Arvind Narayanan\'s article\u2018Digital inequalities will power digital colonialism\u2019. The idea that people are treated differently based on what country they\'re from is pretty standard colonialism.\\n\\nWe can do it digitally now.\\n\\nWhen India was used as a testing ground for a Bing chatbot and users complained to Microsoft about the chatbots abusive behaviour, nothing was done. But when the issues made it to The New York Times, Microsoft made changes within days. That\'s digital colonialism.\\n\\nBut the example he uses that really brings this idea home is of Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (which makes ChatGPT), talking about how people who can\'t afford healthcare, can use a really smart chatbot. The fact they see can\'t see anything wrong with this - that rich people have doctors, poor people have chatbots - is mind-blowing but not surprising.\\n\\n## Why Am I Calling It a \u2018Bullshit Generator\u2019?\\n\\nI got this phrase from Dan McQuillans no-holds-barred piece\u2018We come to bury ChatGPT, not to praise it.\u2019, which I thought was brilliant.\\n\\nDan says:\\n\\n\\"ChatGPT is, in technical terms, a \'**bullshit generator**\'. If a generated sentence makes sense to you, the reader, it means the mathematical model has made sufficiently good guess to pass your sense-making filter.**The language model has no idea what it\'s talking about because it has no idea about anything at all**. It\'s more of a bullshitter than the most egregious egoist you\'ll ever meet, producing baseless assertions withunfailing confidencebecause that\'s what it\'s designed to do.\\"\\n\\nBrilliant because he calls out the uglier realities behind the technology and also the kinds of people and ideas who benefit from such technology and how they count as nothing, \\"the immediate vulnerability of millions of ordinary people\\" exploited for AI\'s gain.\\n\\nI\u2019m pretty sure I could\u2019ve just summed up this whole newsletter with this paragraph. But this is a learning exercise, hence why all the notes \ud83d\ude01.\\n\\n## What Can We Do about this?\\n\\nUnlike AI, I\u2019m okay with saying \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d the answer to a question.\\n\\nBecause I don\u2019t.\\n\\nArvind Narayanan lists a few positives about ChatGPT in\u2018ChatGPT is a bullshit generator. But it can still be amazingly useful\u2019where it can help in context where the truth or accuracy isn\u2019t important (fiction) and debugging code. But then notes a study done that found*\u201cCopilot generated insecure code****40%****of the time.\u201d*.\\n\\nAwesome \ud83d\ude02.\\n\\nI think of \'what can we do?\' in this context - i.e. of the big AI machine and its impending impacts on the world, as well as its current impact on the humans being fed to its development - the same way I look at individual recycling to clean up the world\'s pollution and climate issues: pretty useless at the individual level, and would instead need some sort of massive groundswell force of public opinion and civic action to force the powerful to change the situation.\\n\\nI don\u2019t see that happening.\\n\\nAbstaining from using these tools won\u2019t change anything the same way vegans and the plant-based meat industry haven\u2019t change our meat eating habits.\\n\\nSo, in my humble opinion, learn how AI really works, how it will impact you, your job, and your community. Teach what you know -*actually*know, stop just reading headlines and parroting the marketing bullshit hype - and read widely, discuss, and share with your community.\\n\\nMy \u201calways\u201d take on new tech and it\u2019s almost guaranteed potential for harm to people is the same as in professional fighting - \u201cprotect yourself at all times\u201d.\\n\\n*Thanks for reading.

A NZ born Samoan, Tuvalu and Chinese guy who works in tech (in a nutshell). And I think it\'s relevant because it helps to know who the person is saying a bunch of stuff in a newsletter and get an idea and some context around why they might look at the world a certain way, and say the things they might say.\\n\\nI\'m the second eldest in a family of five boys (no biological sisters). Both my parents immigrated from Samoa in the 70\'s. Dad worked as a land surveyor and Mum worked at the Post Office. Dad eventually went on to study to become a Presbyterian Minister at Knox College and dragged us down to Otago until he graduated after which we then headed off to Pleasant Point, South Canterbury for his first church assignment. We were the only Samoan family in a small farming town of about 1500 people, pretty much all palagi\'s (P\u0101keh\u0101). We spent 5 years behind enemy lines.. kidding, we all got along (eventually), and I actually look back fondly at that period in my life. After Pleasant Point, Dad accepted a new assignment in Glen Eden, West Auckland and we were off again. We went from an all palagi environment, to an almost all Pasifika one in a matter of months transitioning from the South Island to Auckland.\\n\\n\u201cTheCoconet TV\u201d did ashort documentaryabout my family on their series about Pastor\u2019s kids.\\n\\nAnd Auckland is where we stayed until the end of high school.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## When does this get to the tech part?\\n\\nI wasn\'t a geek in high school. I never dreamed of a career in tech. I saw tech how most other people at the time saw tech- some kind of word processing, data entry, maths calculator activity that the nerds did while the kids who had lives were socialising. I played sports, I was in a band, and I hung out with people in real life. I was planning a career in the air force as a pilot right up until 7th form. But when a friend hacked my Dad\'s computer remotely while I was chatting with him that changed everything for me. After 7th form I went and (badly) attempted a BSc in CompSci at the University of Auckland and ended up dropping out. I then got my first tech role on the help desk of a small ISP in the city and over a 20 year period since then, transitioned to web development, then switched to applications support, then systems administration, unix engineering, cloud platform security and now solution architecture at a big tech firm.\\n\\n## So, why tech?\\n\\nWhen my friend hacked my computer, he showed me his mastery of tech meant he had some level of control over things. When you\'re young and feel like you don\'t have a lot of control over your life, something like this opens your mind to a world where you don\'t have to ask permission to learn, to be curious and explore. I wasn\'t interested in academics nor was I going to be a professional sports person. And I wasn\'t part of an affluent social group. But I liked solving the technical puzzles other people couldn\u2019t, or weren\u2019t interested in solving. Puzzles that unlocked knowledge of things, how to build them, how to break them. Mastery of tech was power (and escape to be fair).\\n\\nIt also helped that the thing I got super interested in, became highly \u201cin demand\u201d and important as the years went on too.\\n\\n## In Summary\\n\\nI grew up in a Samoan, Christian household in South Canterbury not fitting in there and then not fitting in, in the largest Polynesian city in the world either. Tech was a way to take some control and carve out my own path, where I would be accepted on the merits of my skill and ability to play the corporate game. My relationship with tech is really about how it empowers a person who doesn\u2019t fit in, in the real world, to make their own way using resources available in the virtual world. And so when I read and think about tech- sure I geek out at the geeky stuff- but what I\u2019m really interested in is how this virtual tech impacts real people in a real society* in real life.\\n\\nThanks for reading. I\'ll see you in the next episode.\\n\\nRon."},{"id":"weekly-newsletter-about-working-in-tech-other-side-effects","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/weekly-newsletter-about-working-in-tech-other-side-effects","editUrl":"https://github.com/ronamosa/ronamosa.github.io/edit/main/website/blog/2023-02-28 - A-Weekly-Newsletter-About-Working-in-Tech-and-Other-Side-Effects.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-28 - A-Weekly-Newsletter-About-Working-in-Tech-and-Other-Side-Effects.md","title":"A Weekly Newsletter About Working in Tech and Other Side-Effects.","description":"Newsletter launch announcement establishing weekly writing discipline combining tech topics with Pasifika perspectives and lived experience.

I started a newsletter back in 2018 and ran it for several editions before it got lost somewhere and came to it\u2019s inevitable end.\\n\\nIt\u2019s always hard starting something back up again, but if experience has taught me anything, it\u2019s that once it\u2019s up and running it\u2019s not that bad.\\n\\nLike going to the gym. The first few weeks are probably going to be painful, but if you stick at it, eventually it sucks a little less each time.\\n\\n### Why am I starting a newsletter?\\n\\nBelieve it or not, it\u2019s not to be a writer.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFor as long as I can remember I loved consuming information to learn and know about things. I\u2019ve got random trivia and useless knowledge for days. But I never feel like I really*know*anything that well, I just have a general idea about a lot of things.\\n\\nThe last time I felt like I genuinely understood something well was back at University when I had no choice but to*focus*on a subject, week in and week out, listening to lectures about it, writing about it and then getting examined.\\n\\nI want to try some of that focus and commitment to reading thoughtfully and deliberately and then writing something about it. Every week. In a newsletter.\\n\\nA weekly newsletter might be a bit ambitious, sure, but if I can build a discipline of reading with my brain engaged, and then producing a piece of writing that shows an understanding of that topic, I really don\u2019t see a downside.\\n\\n### Who might be interested in my newsletter?\\n\\nGood question.\\n\\nAre you interested in Cloud Infrastructure & Technology? DevSecOps? CICD & Automation? IT Architecture? Hacking & Cyber Security? AI? Crypto? Linux and Containers?\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nAre you interested in how these technologies, and the careers and economics they bring, impact Pasifika people and communities in both positive and negative ways?\\n\\nGreat.\\n\\nMight you also be interested in the views and opinions of someone, who identifies as Pasifika, and has worked in tech for almost two decades, local and overseas, with experience across several technical roles and also worked in a couple of Fortune 500 companies?\\n\\nAwesome!\\n\\nThis newsletter probably has something in it for you.\\n\\n### Where and When?\\n\\nI will publish a newsletter weekly on Tues mornings.\\n\\nI don\u2019t have any plans for paid subscriptions like I said this is a thought-wrangling and writing exercise for my untamed brain.\\n\\nYou all get the pleasure of coming along for the ride.\\n\\nSo, if this all sounds like a bit of you every week\u2026\\n\\nand we\u2019ll see you in the next episode \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd"}]}}')}}]);
